<h2>PROSERPINA.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Brantwood</span>, <i>14th March, 1874.</i>

  <p>Yesterday evening I was looking over the first book in which I studied
  Botany,&mdash;Curtis's Magazine, published in 1795 at No. 3, St. George's
  Crescent, Blackfriars Road, and sold by the principal booksellers in
  Great Britain and Ireland. Its plates are excellent, so that I am always
  glad to find in it the picture of a flower I know. And I came yesterday
  upon what I suppose to be a variety of a favourite flower of mine,
  called, in Curtis, "the St. Bruno's Lily."</p>

  <p>I am obliged to say "what I suppose to be a variety," because my pet
  lily is branched,<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> while
  this is drawn as unbranched, and especially stated to be so. And the page
  of text, in which this statement is made, is so characteristic of
  botanical books, and botanical science, not to say all science as
  hitherto taught for the blessing of mankind; <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span> and of the difficulties
  thereby accompanying its communication, that I extract the page entire,
  printing it, opposite, as nearly as possible in facsimile.</p>

  <p>Now you observe, in this instructive page, that you have in the first
  place, nine names given you for one flower; and that among these nine
  names, you are not even at liberty to make your choice, because the
  united authority of Haller and Miller may be considered as an accurate
  balance to the single authority of Linnæus; and you ought therefore for
  the present to remain, yourself, balanced between the sides. You may be
  farther embarrassed by finding that the Anthericum of Savoy is only
  described as growing in Switzerland. And farther still, by finding that
  Mr. Miller describes two varieties of it, which differ only in size,
  while you are left to conjecture whether the one here figured is the
  larger or smaller; and how great the difference is.</p>

  <p>Farther, If you wish to know anything of the habits of the plant, as
  well as its nine names, you are informed that it grows both at the
  bottoms of the mountains, and the tops; and that, with us, it flowers in
  May and June,&mdash;but you are not told when, in its native country.</p>

  <p>The four lines of the last clause but one, may indeed be useful to
  gardeners; but&mdash;although I know my good father and mother did the
  best they could for me in buying this beautiful book; and though the
  admirable plates of it did their work, and taught me much, I cannot
  wonder that neither my infantine nor boyish mind was irresistibly
  attracted by the text of which this page is one of the most favourable
  specimens; nor, in consequence, that my botanical studies were&mdash;when
  I had attained the age of fifty&mdash;no farther advanced than the reader
  will find them in the opening chapter of this book.</p>

  <p>Botanists are divided in their opinions respecting the genus of this
  plant; <span class="sc">Linnæus</span> considers it as an
  <i>Anthericum</i>, <span class="sc">Haller</span> and <span
  class="sc">Miller</span> make it an <i>Hemerocallis</i>.</p>

  <p>It is a native of Switzerland, where, <span class="sc">Haller</span>
  informs us it grows abundantly in the Alpine meadows, and even on the
  summits of the mountains; with us it flowers in May and June.</p>

  <p>It is a plant of great elegance, producing on an unbranched stem about
  a foot and a half high, numerous flowers of a delicate white colour, much
  smaller but resembling in form those of the common white lily, possessing
  a considerable degree of fragrance, their beauty is heightened by the
  rich orange colour of their antheræ; unfortunately they are but of short
  duration.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Miller</span> describes two varieties of it differing
  merely in size.</p>

  <p>A loamy soil, a situation moderately moist, with an eastern or western
  exposure, suits this plant best; so situated, it will increase by its
  roots, though not very fast, and by parting of these in the autumn, it is
  usually propagated.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Parkinson</span> describes and figures it in his
  <i>Parad. Terrest.</i>, observing that "divers allured by the beauty of
  its flowers, had brought it into these parts."</p>

  <p>Which said book was therefore undertaken, to put, if it might be, some
  elements of the science of botany into a form more tenable by ordinary
  human and childish faculties; or&mdash;for I can scarcely say I have yet
  any tenure of it myself&mdash;to make the paths of approach to it more
  pleasant. In fact, I only know, of it, the pleasant distant effects which
  it bears to simple eyes; and some pretty mists and mysteries, which I
  invite my young readers to pierce, as they may, for themselves,&mdash;my
  power of guiding them being only for a little way.</p>

  <p>Pretty mysteries, I say, as opposed to the vulgar and ugly mysteries
  of the so-called science of botany,&mdash;exemplified sufficiently in
  this chosen page. Respecting which, please observe
  farther;&mdash;Nobody&mdash;I can say this very boldly&mdash;loves Latin
  more dearly than I; but, precisely because I do love it (as well as for
  other reasons), I have always insisted that books, whether scientific or
  not, ought to be written either in Latin, or English; and not in a
  doggish mixture of the refuse of both.</p>

  <p>Linnæus wrote a noble book of universal Natural History in Latin. It
  is one of the permanent classical treasures of the world. And if any
  scientific man thinks his labors are worth the world's attention, let
  him, also, write <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>[5]</span> what he has to say in Latin, finishedly and
  exquisitely, if it take him a month to a page.<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But if&mdash;which, unless he be one chosen of millions, is assuredly
  the fact&mdash;his lucubrations are only of local and temporary
  consequence, let him write, as clearly as he can, in his native
  language.</p>

  <p>This book, accordingly, I have written in English; (not, by the way,
  that I <i>could</i> have written it in anything else&mdash;so there are
  small thanks to me); and one of its purposes is to interpret, for young
  English readers, the necessary European Latin or Greek names of flowers,
  and to make them vivid and vital to their understandings. But two great
  difficulties occur in doing this. The first, that there are generally
  from three or four, up to two dozen, Latin names current for every
  flower; and every new botanist thinks his eminence only to be properly
  asserted by adding another.</p>

  <p>The second, and a much more serious one, is of the Devil's own
  contriving&mdash;(and remember I am always quite serious when I speak of
  the Devil,)&mdash;namely, that the most current and authoritative names
  are apt to be founded on some unclean or debasing association, so that to
  interpret them is to defile the reader's mind. I will give no instance;
  too many will at once occur to any <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span> learned reader, and the
  unlearned I need not vex with so much as one: but, in such cases, since I
  could only take refuge in the untranslated word by leaving other Greek or
  Latin words also untranslated, and the nomenclature still entirely
  senseless,&mdash;and I do not choose to do this,&mdash;there is only one
  other course open to me, namely, to substitute boldly, to my own pupils,
  other generic names for the plants thus faultfully hitherto titled.</p>

  <p>As I do not do this for my own pride, but honestly for my reader's
  service, I neither question nor care how far the emendations I propose
  may be now or hereafter adopted. I shall not even name the cases in which
  they have been made for the serious reason above specified; but even
  shall mask those which there was real occasion to alter, by sometimes
  giving new names in cases where there was no necessity of such kind.
  Doubtless I shall be accused of doing myself what I violently blame in
  others. I do so; but with a different motive&mdash;of which let the
  reader judge as he is disposed. The practical result will be that the
  children who learn botany on the system adopted in this book will know
  the useful and beautiful names of plants hitherto given, in all
  languages; the useless and ugly ones they will not know. And they will
  have to learn one Latin name for each plant, which, when differing from
  the common one, I trust may yet by some scientific persons be accepted,
  and with ultimate advantage.</p>

  <p>The learning of the one Latin name&mdash;as, for instance, Gramen
  striatum&mdash;I hope will be accurately enforced <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span> always;&mdash;but not less
  carefully the learning of the pretty English one&mdash;"Ladielace
  Grass"&mdash;with due observance that "Ladies' laces hath leaves like
  unto Millet in fashion, with many white vaines or ribs, and silver
  strakes running along through the middest of the leaves, fashioning the
  same like to laces of white and green silk, very beautiful and faire to
  behold."</p>

  <p>I have said elsewhere, and can scarcely repeat too often, that a day
  will come when men of science will think their names disgraced, instead
  of honoured, by being used to barbarise nomenclature; I hope therefore
  that my own name may be kept well out of the way; but, having been
  privileged to found the School of Art in the University of Oxford, I
  think that I am justified in requesting any scientific writers who may
  look kindly upon this book, to add such of the names suggested in it as
  they think deserving of acceptance, to their own lists of synonyms, under
  the head of "Schol. Art. Oxon."</p>

  <p>The difficulties thrown in the way of any quiet private student by
  existing nomenclature may be best illustrated by my simply stating what
  happens to myself in endeavouring to use the page above facsimile'd. Not
  knowing how far St. Bruno's Lily might be connected with my own pet one,
  and not having any sufficient book on Swiss botany, I take down Loudon's
  Encyclopædia of Plants, (a most useful book, as far as any book in the
  present state of the science <i>can</i> be useful,) and find, under the
  head of Anthericum, the Savoy Lily indeed, but only the <!-- Page 8
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span> following general
  information:&mdash;"809. Anthericum. A name applied by the Greeks to the
  stem of the asphodel, and not misapplied to this set of plants, which in
  some sort resemble the asphodel. Plants with fleshy leaves, and spikes of
  bright <i>yellow</i> flowers, easily cultivated if kept dry."</p>

  <p>Hunting further, I find again my Savoy lily called a spider-plant,
  under the article Hemerocallis, and the only information which the book
  gives me under Hemerocallis, is that it means 'beautiful day' lily; and
  then, "This is an ornamental genus of the easiest culture. The species
  are remarkable among border flowers for their fine <i>orange</i>,
  <i>yellow</i>, or <i>blue</i> flowers. The Hemerocallis c&oelig;rulea has
  been considered a distinct genus by Mr. Salisbury, and called Saussurea."
  As I correct this sheet for press, however, I find that the Hemerocallis
  is now to be called 'Funkia,' "in honour of Mr. Funk, a Prussian
  apothecary."</p>

  <p>All this while, meantime, I have a suspicion that my pet Savoy Lily is
  not, in existing classification, an Anthericum, nor a Hemerocallis, but a
  Lilium. It is, in fact, simply a Turk's cap which doesn't curl up. But on
  trying 'Lilium' in Loudon, I find no mention whatever of any wild
  branched white lily.</p>

  <p>I then try the next word in my specimen page of Curtis; but there is
  no 'Phalangium' at all in Loudon's index. And now I have neither time nor
  mind for more search, but will give, in due place, such account as I can
  <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[9]</span> of my
  own dwarf branched lily, which I shall call St. Bruno's, as well as this
  Liliastrum&mdash;no offence to the saint, I hope. For it grows very
  gloriously on the limestones of Savoy, presumably, therefore, at the
  Grande Chartreuse; though I did not notice it there, and made a very
  unmonkish use of it when I gathered it last:&mdash;There was a pretty
  young English lady at the table-d'hôte, in the Hotel du Mont Blanc at St.
  Martin's,<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and I wanted to
  get speech of her, and didn't know how. So all I could think of was to go
  half-way up the Aiguille de Varens, to gather St. Bruno's lilies; and I
  made a great cluster of them, and put wild roses all around them as I
  came down. I never saw anything so lovely; and I thought to present this
  to her before dinner,&mdash;but when I got down, she had gone away to
  Chamouni. My Fors always treated me like that, in affairs of the
  heart.</p>

  <p>I had begun my studies of Alpine botany just eighteen years before, in
  1842, by making a careful drawing of wood-sorrel at Chamouni; and
  bitterly sorry I am, now, that the work was interrupted. For I drew,
  then, very delicately; and should have made a pretty book if I could have
  got peace. Even yet, I can manage my point a little, and would far rather
  be making outlines of flowers, than writing; and I meant to have drawn
  every English and Scottish wild flower, like this cluster of bog heather
  opposite,<a name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>&mdash;back, and
  profile, and front. But 'Blackwood's <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span> Magazine,' with its
  insults to Turner, dragged me into controversy; and I have not had,
  properly speaking, a day's peace since; so that in 1868 my botanical
  studies were advanced only as far as the reader will see in next chapter;
  and now, in 1874, must end altogether, I suppose, heavier thoughts and
  work coming fast on me. So that, finding among my notebooks, two or
  three, full of broken materials for the proposed work on flowers; and,
  thinking they may be useful even as fragments, I am going to publish them
  in their present state,&mdash;only let the reader note that while my
  other books endeavour, and claim, so far as they reach, to give
  trustworthy knowledge of their subjects, this one only shows how such
  knowledge may be obtained; and it is little more than a history of
  efforts and plans,&mdash;but of both, I believe, made in right
  methods.</p>

  <p>One part of the book, however, will, I think, be found of permanent
  value. Mr. Burgess has engraved on wood, in reduced size, with consummate
  skill, some of the excellent old drawings in the Flora Danica, and has
  interpreted, and facsimile'd, some of his own and my drawings from
  nature, with a vigour and precision unsurpassed in woodcut illustration,
  which render these outlines the best exercises in black and white I have
  yet been able to <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>[11]</span> prepare for my drawing pupils. The larger
  engravings by Mr. Allen may also be used with advantage as copies for
  drawings with pen or sepia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">MOSS.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Denmark Hill</span>, <i>3rd November, 1868.</i>

  <p>1. It is mortifying enough to write,&mdash;but I think thus much ought
  to be written,&mdash;concerning myself, as 'the author of Modern
  Painters.' In three months I shall be fifty years old: and I don't at
  this hour&mdash;ten o'clock in the morning of the two hundred and
  sixty-eighth day of my forty-ninth year&mdash;know what 'moss' is.</p>

  <p>There is nothing I have more <i>intended</i> to know&mdash;some day or
  other. But the moss 'would always be there'; and then it was so
  beautiful, and so difficult to examine, that one could only do it in some
  quite separated time of happy leisure&mdash;which came not. I never was
  like to have less leisure than now, but I <i>will</i> know what moss is,
  if possible, forthwith.</p>

  <p>2. To that end I read preparatorily, yesterday, what account I could
  find of it in all the botanical books in the house. Out of them all, I
  get this general notion of a moss,&mdash;that it has a fine fibrous
  root,&mdash;a stem surrounded with spirally set leaves,&mdash;and
  produces its fruit in a small case, under a cap. I fasten especially,
  however, on a <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>[13]</span> sentence of Louis Figuier's, about the
  particular species, Hypnum:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"These mosses, which often form little islets of verdure at the feet
  of poplars and willows, are robust vegetable organisms, which do not
  decay."<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>3. "Qui ne pourrissent point." What do they do with themselves,
  then?&mdash;it immediately occurs to me to ask. And, secondly,&mdash;If
  this immortality belongs to the Hypnum only?</p>

  <p>It certainly does not, by any means: but, however modified or limited,
  this immortality is the first thing we ought to take note of in the
  mosses. They are, in some degree, what the "everlasting" is in flowers.
  Those minute green leaves of theirs do not decay, nor fall.</p>

  <p>But how do they die, or how stop growing, then?&mdash;it is the first
  thing I want to know about them. And from all the books in the house, I
  can't as yet find out this. Meanwhile I will look at the leaves
  themselves.</p>

  <p>4. Going out to the garden, I bring in a bit of old brick, emerald
  green on its rugged surface,<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and a thick piece of mossy turf.</p>

  <p>First, for the old brick: To think of the quantity of pleasure one has
  had in one's life from that emerald green velvet,&mdash;and yet that for
  the first time to-day I am verily going to look at it! Doing so, through
  a pocket <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[14]</span> lens of no great power, I find the velvet
  to be composed of small star-like groups of smooth, strong, oval
  leaves,&mdash;intensely green, and much like the young leaves of any
  other plant, except in this;&mdash;they all have a long brown spike, like
  a sting, at their ends.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/fig1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig1.png"
      alt="Fig. 1. Leaves of a moss." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 1.
  </div>
  <p>5. Fastening on that, I take the Flora Danica,<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and look through its plates of mosses,
  for their leaves only; and I find, first, that this spike, or strong
  central rib, is characteristic;&mdash;secondly, that the said leaves are
  apt to be not only spiked, but serrated, and otherwise angry-looking at
  the points;&mdash;thirdly, that they have a tendency to fold together in
  the centre (Fig. 1<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>); and
  at last, after an hour's work at them, it strikes me suddenly that they
  are more like pineapple leaves than anything else.</p>

  <p>And it occurs to me, very unpleasantly, at the same time, that I don't
  know what a pineapple is!</p>

  <p>Stopping to ascertain that, I am told that a pineapple belongs to the
  'Bromeliaceæ'&mdash;(can't stop to find out what that means)&mdash;nay,
  that of these plants "the pineapple is the representative" (Loudon);
  "their habit is acid, their leaves rigid, and toothed with spines, their
  <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[15]</span>
  bracteas often coloured with scarlet, and their flowers either white or
  blue"&mdash;(what are their flowers like?) But the two sentences that
  most interest me, are, that in the damp forests of Carolina, the
  Tillandsia, which is an 'epiphyte' (<i>i.e.</i>, a plant growing on other
  plants,) "forms dense festoons among the branches of the trees,
  vegetating among the black mould that collects upon the bark of trees in
  hot damp countries; other species are inhabitants of deep and gloomy
  forests, and others form, with their spring leaves, an impenetrable
  herbage in the Pampas of Brazil." So they really seem to be a kind of
  moss, on a vast scale.</p>

  <p>6. Next, I find in Gray,<a name="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Bromeliaceæ, and&mdash;the very thing I
  want&mdash;"Tillandsia, the black <i>moss</i>, or long moss, which,
  <i>like most Bromelias</i>, grows on the branches of trees." So the
  pineapple is really a moss; only it is a moss that flowers but
  'imperfectly.' "The fine fruit is caused by the consolidation of the
  imperfect flowers." (I wish we could consolidate some imperfect English
  moss-flowers into little pineapples then,&mdash;though they were only as
  big as filberts.) But we cannot follow that farther now; nor consider
  when a flower is perfect, and when it is not, or we should get into
  morals, and I don't know where else; we will go back to the moss I have
  gathered, for I begin to see my way, a little, to understanding it.</p>

<p><!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[16]</span></p>

  <p>7. The second piece I have on the table is a cluster&mdash;an inch or
  two deep&mdash;of the moss that grows everywhere, and that the birds use
  for nest-building, and we for packing, and the like. It is dry, since
  yesterday, and its fibres define themselves against the dark ground in
  warm green, touched with a glittering light. Note that burnished lustre
  of the minute leaves; they are necessarily always relieved against dark
  hollows, and this lustre makes them much clearer and brighter than if
  they were of dead green. In that lustre&mdash;and it is characteristic of
  them&mdash;they differ wholly from the dead, aloe-like texture of the
  pineapple leaf; and remind me, as I look at them closely, a little of
  some conditions of chaff, as on heads of wheat after being threshed. I
  will hunt down that clue presently; meantime there is something else to
  be noticed on the old brick.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/fig2.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig2.png"
      alt="Fig. 2. Detail of Dicranum cerviculatum." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 2.
  </div>
  <p>8. Out of its emerald green cushions of minute leaves, there rise,
  here and there, thin red threads, each with a little brown cap, or
  something like a cap, at the top of it. These red threads shooting up out
  of the green tufts, are, I believe, the fructification of the moss;
  fringing its surface in the woods, and on the rocks, with the small
  forests of brown stems, each carrying its pointed cap or crest&mdash;of
  infinitely varied 'mode,' as we shall see presently; and, which is one of
  their most blessed functions, carrying high the dew in the morning; every
  spear balancing its own crystal globe.</p>

  <p>9. And now, with my own broken memories of moss <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>[17]</span> and this unbroken,
  though unfinished, gift of the noble labour of other people, the Flora
  Danica, I can generalize the idea of the precious little plant, for
  myself, and for the reader.</p>

  <p>All mosses, I believe, (with such exceptions and collateral groups as
  we may afterwards discover, but they are not many,) that is to say, some
  thousands of species, are, in their strength of existence, composed of
  fibres surrounded by clusters of dry <i>spinous</i> leaves, set close to
  the fibre they grow on. Out of this leafy stern descends a fibrous root,
  and ascends in its season, a capped seed.</p>

  <p>We must get this very clearly into our heads. Fig. 2, <span
  class="scac">A</span>, is a little tuft of a common wood moss of
  Norway,<a name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> in its fruit
  season, of its real size; but at present I want to look at the central
  fibre and its leaves accurately, and understand that first.</p>

  <p>10. Pulling it to pieces, we find it composed of seven little
  company-keeping fibres, each of which, by itself, appears as in Fig. 2,
  <span class="scac">B</span>: but as in this, its real size, it <!-- Page
  18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[18]</span> is too
  small, not indeed for our respect, but for our comprehension, we magnify
  it, Fig. 2, <span class="scac">C</span>, and thereupon perceive it to be
  indeed composed of, <i>a</i>, the small fibrous root which sustains the
  plant; <i>b</i>, the leaf-surrounded stem which is the actual being, and
  main creature, moss; and, <i>c</i>, the aspirant pillar, and cap, of its
  fructification.</p>

  <p>11. But there is one minor division yet. You see I have drawn the
  central part of the moss plant (<i>b</i>, Fig. 2,) half in outline and
  half in black; and that, similarly, in the upper group, which is too
  small to show the real roots, the base of the cluster is black. And you
  remember, I doubt not, how often in gathering what most invited
  gathering, of deep green, starry, perfectly soft and living wood-moss,
  you found it fall asunder in your hand into multitudes of separate
  threads, each with its bright green crest, and long root of
  blackness.</p>

  <p>That blackness at the root&mdash;though only so notable in this
  wood-moss and collateral species, is indeed a general character of the
  mosses, with rare exceptions. It is their funeral blackness;&mdash;that,
  I perceive, is the way the moss leaves die. They do not fall&mdash;they
  do not visibly decay. But they decay <i>in</i>visibly, in continual
  secession, beneath the ascending crest. They rise to form that crest, all
  green and bright, and take the light and air from those out of which they
  grew;&mdash;and those, their ancestors, darken and die slowly, and at
  last become a mass of mouldering ground. In fact, as I perceive farther,
  their final duty is so to die. The main work of other leaves is <!-- Page
  19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span> in their
  life,&mdash;but these have to form the earth out of which all other
  leaves are to grow. Not to cover the rocks with golden velvet only, but
  to fill their crannies with the dark earth, through which nobler
  creatures shall one day seek their being.</p>

  <p>12. "Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss." Pope could not have
  known the hundredth part of the number of 'sorts' of moss there are; and
  I suppose he only chose the word because it was a monosyllable beginning
  with m, and the best English general expression for despised and minute
  structures of plants. But a fate rules the words of wise men, which makes
  their words truer, and worth more, than the men themselves know. No other
  plants have so endless variety on so similar a structure as the mosses;
  and none teach so well the humility of Death. As for the death of our
  bodies, we have learned, wisely, or unwisely, to look the fact of that in
  the face. But none of us, I think, yet care to look the fact of the death
  of our minds in the face. I do not mean death of our souls, but of our
  mental work. So far as it is good <i>art</i>, indeed, and done in
  realistic form, it may perhaps not die; but so far as it was only good
  <i>thought</i>&mdash;good, for its time, and apparently a great
  achievement therein&mdash;that good, useful thought may yet in the future
  become a foolish thought, and then die quite away,&mdash;it, and the
  memory of it,&mdash;when better thought and knowledge come. But the
  better thought could not have come if the weaker thought had not come
  first, and died in sustaining the <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[20]</span> better. If we think
  honestly, our thoughts will not only live usefully, but even perish
  usefully&mdash;like the moss&mdash;and become dark, not without due
  service. But if we think dishonestly, or malignantly, our thoughts will
  die like evil fungi,&mdash;dripping corrupt dew.</p>

  <p>13. But farther. If you have walked moorlands enough to know the look
  of them, you know well those flat spaces or causeways of bright green or
  golden ground between the heathy rock masses; which signify winding pools
  and inlets of stagnant water caught among the rocks;&mdash;pools which
  the deep moss that covers them&mdash;<i>blanched</i>, not black, at the
  root,&mdash;is slowly filling and making firm; whence generally the
  unsafe ground in the moorland gets known by being <i>mossy</i> instead of
  heathy; and is at last called by its riders, briefly, 'the Moss': and as
  it is mainly at these same mossy places that the riding is difficult, and
  brings out the gifts of horse and rider, and discomfits all followers not
  similarly gifted, the skilled crosser of them got his name, naturally, of
  'moss-rider,' or moss-trooper. In which manner the moss of Norway and
  Scotland has been a taskmaster and Maker of Soldiers, as yet, the
  strongest known among natural powers. The lightning may kill a man, or
  cast down a tower, but these little tender leaves of moss&mdash;they and
  their progenitors&mdash;have trained the Northern Armies.</p>

  <p>14. So much for the human meaning of that decay of the leaves. Now to
  go back to the little creatures themselves. It seems that the upper part
  of the moss fibre is <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>[21]</span> especially <i>un</i>decaying among leaves;
  and the lower part, especially decaying. That, in fact, a plant of
  moss-fibre is a kind of persistent state of what is, in other plants,
  annual. Watch the year's growth of any luxuriant flower. First it comes
  out of the ground all fresh and bright; then, as the higher leaves and
  branches shoot up, those first leaves near the ground get brown, sickly,
  earthy,&mdash;remain for ever degraded in the dust, and under the dashed
  slime in rain, staining, and grieving, and loading them with obloquy of
  envious earth, half-killing them,&mdash;only life enough left in them to
  hold on the stem, and to be guardians of the rest of the plant from all
  they suffer;&mdash;while, above them, the happier leaves, for whom they
  are thus oppressed, bend freely to the sunshine, and drink the rain
  pure.</p>

  <p>The moss strengthens on a diminished scale, intensifies, and makes
  perpetual, these two states,&mdash;bright leaves above that never wither,
  leaves beneath that exist only to wither.</p>

  <p>15. I have hitherto spoken only of the fading moss as it is needed for
  change into earth. But I am not sure whether a yet more important office,
  in its days of age, be not its use as a colour.</p>

  <p>We are all thankful enough&mdash;as far as we ever are so&mdash;for
  green moss, and yellow moss. But we are never enough grateful for black
  moss. The golden would be nothing without it, nor even the grey.</p>

  <p>It is true that there are black lichens enough, and <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span> brown ones:
  nevertheless, the chief use of lichens is for silver and gold colour on
  rocks; and it is the dead moss which gives the leopard-like touches of
  black. And yet here again&mdash;as to a thing I have been looking at and
  painting all my life&mdash;I am brought to pause, the moment I think of
  it carefully. The black moss which gives the precious Velasquez touches,
  lies, much of it, flat on the rocks; radiating from its
  centres&mdash;powdering in the fingers, if one breaks it off, like dry
  tea. Is it a black species?&mdash;or a black-parched state of other
  species, perishing for the sake of Velasquez effects, instead of
  accumulation of earth? and, if so, does it die of drought, accidentally,
  or, in a sere old age, naturally? and how is it related to the rich green
  bosses that grow in deep velvet? And there again is another matter not
  clear to me. One calls them 'velvet' because they are all brought to an
  even surface at the top. Our own velvet is reduced to such trimness by
  cutting. But how is the moss trimmed? By what scissors? Carefullest
  Elizabethan gardener never shaped his yew hedge more daintily than the
  moss fairies smooth these soft rounded surfaces of green and gold. And
  just fancy the difference, if they were ragged! If the fibres had every
  one of them leave to grow at their own sweet will, and to be long or
  short as they liked, or, worse still, urged by fairy prizes into
  laboriously and agonizingly trying which could grow longest. Fancy the
  surface of a spot of competitive moss!</p>

  <p>16. But how is it that they are subdued into that <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span> spherical
  obedience, like a crystal of wavellite?<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Strange&mdash;that the vegetable
  creatures growing so fondly on rocks should form themselves in that
  mineral-like manner. It is true that the tops of all well-grown trees are
  rounded, on a large scale, as equally; but that is because they grow from
  a central stem, while these mossy mounds are made out of independent
  filaments, each growing to exactly his proper height in the
  sphere&mdash;short ones outside, long in the middle. Stop, though;
  <i>is</i> that so? I am not even sure of that; perhaps they are built
  over a little dome of decayed moss below.<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> I must find out how every <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span> filament grows,
  separately&mdash;from root to cap, through the spirally set leaves. And
  meanwhile I don't know very clearly so much as what a root is&mdash;or
  what a leaf is. Before puzzling myself any farther in examination either
  of moss or any other grander vegetable, I had better define these primal
  forms of all vegetation, as well as I can&mdash;or rather begin the
  definition of them, for future completion and correction. For, as my
  reader must already sufficiently perceive, this book is literally to be
  one of studies&mdash;not of statements. Some one said of me once, very
  shrewdly, When he wants to work out a subject, he writes a book on it.
  That is a very true saying in the main,&mdash;I work down or up to my
  mark, and let the reader see process and progress, not caring to conceal
  them. But this book will be nothing but process. I don't mean to assert
  anything positively in it from the first page to the last. Whatever I
  say, is to be understood only as a conditional statement&mdash;liable to,
  and inviting, correction. And this the more because, as on the whole, I
  am at war with the botanists, I can't ask them to help me, and then <!--
  Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span> call
  them names afterwards. I hope only for a contemptuous heaping of coals on
  my head by correction of my errors from them;&mdash;in some cases, my
  scientific friends will, I know, give me forgiving aid;&mdash;but, for
  many reasons, I am forced first to print the imperfect statement, as I
  can independently shape it; for if once I asked for, or received help,
  every thought would be frostbitten into timid expression, and every
  sentence broken by apology. I should have to write a dozen of letters
  before I could print a line, and the line, at last, would be only like a
  bit of any other botanical book&mdash;trustworthy, it might be, perhaps;
  but certainly unreadable. Whereas now, it will rather put things more
  forcibly in the reader's mind to have them retouched and corrected as we
  go on; and our natural and honest mistakes will often be suggestive of
  things we could not have discovered but by wandering.</p>

  <p>On these guarded conditions, then, I proceed to study, with my reader,
  the first general laws of vegetable form.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE ROOT.</p>

  <p>1. Plants in their perfect form consist of four principal
  parts,&mdash;the Root, Stem, Leaf, and Flower. It is true that the stem
  and flower are parts, or remnants, or altered states, of the leaves; and
  that, speaking with close accuracy, we might say, a perfect plant
  consists of leaf and root. But the division into these four parts is best
  for practical purposes, and it will be desirable to note a few general
  facts about each, before endeavouring to describe any one kind of plant.
  Only, because the character of the stem depends on the nature of the leaf
  and flower, we must put it last in order of examination; and trace the
  development of the plant first in root and leaf; then in the flower and
  its fruit; and lastly in the stem.</p>

  <p>2. First, then, the Root.</p>

  <p>Every plant is divided, as I just said, in the main, into two parts,
  and these have opposite natures. One part seeks the light; the other
  hates it. One part feeds on the air; the other on the dust.</p>

  <p>The part that loves the light is called the Leaf. It is an old Saxon
  word; I cannot get at its origin. The part that hates the light is called
  the Root. <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span></p>

  <p>In Greek, <span title="rhiza" class="grk"><span class="correction"
  title="'&rho;&iota;&zeta;&alpha;' (soft breath mark) in original"
  >&#x1FE5;&#x1F77;&zeta;&alpha;</span></span>, Rhiza.<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Latin, Radix, "the growing thing," which shortens, in French, into
  Race, and then they put on the diminutive 'ine,' and get their two words,
  Race, and Racine, of which we keep Race for animals, and use for
  vegetables a word of our own Saxon (and Dutch) dialect,&mdash;'root';
  (connected with Rood&mdash;an image of wood; whence at last the Holy
  Rood, or Tree).</p>

  <p>3. The Root has three great functions:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1st. To hold the plant in its place.</p>
      <p>2nd. To nourish it with earth.</p>
      <p>3rd. To receive vital power for it from the earth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With this last office is in some degree,&mdash;and especially in
  certain plants,&mdash;connected, that of reproduction.</p>

  <p>But in all plants the root has these three essential functions.</p>

  <p>First, I said, to hold the Plant in its place. The Root is its
  Fetter.</p>

  <p>You think it, perhaps, a matter of course that a plant is not to be a
  crawling thing? It is not a matter of course at all. A vegetable might be
  just what it is now, as compared with an animal;&mdash;might live on
  earth and water instead of on meat,&mdash;might be as senseless in life,
  as calm in death, and in all its parts and apparent structure <!-- Page
  28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span> unchanged;
  and yet be a crawling thing. It is quite as easy to conceive plants
  moving about like lizards, putting forward first one root and then
  another, as it is to think of them fastened to their place. It might have
  been well for them, one would have thought, to have the power of going
  down to the streams to drink, in time of drought;&mdash;of migrating in
  winter with grim march from north to south of Dunsinane Hill side. But
  that is not their appointed Fate. They are&mdash;at least all the noblest
  of them, rooted to their spot. Their honour and use is in giving
  immoveable shelter,&mdash;in remaining landmarks, or lovemarks, when all
  else is changed:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The cedars wave on Lebanon,</p>
      <p>But Judah's statelier maids are gone."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>4. Its root is thus a form of fate to the tree. It condemns, or
  indulges it, in its place. These semi-living creatures, come what may,
  shall abide, happy, or tormented. No doubt concerning "the position in
  which Providence has placed <i>them</i>" is to trouble their minds,
  except so far as they can mend it by seeking light, or shrinking from
  wind, or grasping at support, within certain limits. In the thoughts of
  men they have thus become twofold images,&mdash;on the one side, of
  spirits restrained and half destroyed, whence the fables of
  transformation into trees; on the other, of spirits patient and
  continuing, having root in themselves and in good ground, capable of all
  persistent <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>[29]</span> effort and vital stability, both in
  themselves, and for the human States they form.</p>

  <p>5. In this function of holding fast, roots have a power of grasp quite
  different from that of branches. It is not a grasp, or clutch by
  contraction, as that of a bird's claw, or of the small branches we call
  'tendrils' in climbing plants. It is a dead, clumsy, but inevitable
  grasp, by swelling, <i>after</i> contortion. For there is this main
  difference between a branch and root, that a branch cannot grow vividly
  but in certain directions and relations to its neighbour branches; but a
  root can grow wherever there is earth, and can turn in any direction to
  avoid an obstacle.<a name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>6. In thus contriving access for itself where it chooses, a root
  contorts itself into more serpent-like writhing than branches can; and
  when it has once coiled partly round a rock, or stone, it grasps it
  tight, necessarily, merely by swelling. Now a root has force enough
  sometimes to split rocks, but not to crush them; so it is compelled to
  grasp by <i>flattening</i> as it thickens; and, as it must have room
  somewhere, it alters its own shape as if it were made of <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span> dough, and
  holds the rock, not in a claw, but in a wooden cast or mould, adhering to
  its surface. And thus it not only finds its anchorage in the rock, but
  binds the rocks of its anchorage with a constrictor cable.</p>

  <p>7. Hence&mdash;and this is a most important secondary
  function&mdash;roots bind together the ragged edges of rocks as a hem
  does the torn edge of a dress: they literally stitch the stones together;
  so that, while it is always dangerous to pass under a treeless edge of
  overhanging crag, as soon as it has become beautiful with trees, it is
  safe also. The rending power of roots on rocks has been greatly
  overrated. Capillary attraction in a willow wand will indeed split
  granite, and swelling roots sometimes heave considerable masses aside,
  but on the whole, roots, small and great, bind, and do not rend.<a
  name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> The surfaces of mountains
  are dissolved and disordered, by rain, and frost, and chemical
  decomposition, into mere heaps of loose stones on their desolate summits;
  but, where the forests grow, soil accumulates and disintegration ceases.
  And by cutting down forests on great mountain slopes, not only is the
  climate destroyed, but the danger of superficial landslip fearfully
  increased.</p>

  <p>8. The second function of roots is to gather for the plant the
  nourishment it needs from the ground. This is <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>[31]</span> partly water, mixed with
  some kinds of air (ammonia, etc.,) but the plant can get both water and
  ammonia from the atmosphere; and, I believe, for the most part does so;
  though, when it cannot get water from the air, it will gladly drink by
  its roots. But the things it cannot receive from the air at all are
  certain earthy salts, essential to it (as iron is essential in our own
  blood), and of which when it has quite exhausted the earth, no more such
  plants can grow in that ground. On this subject you will find enough in
  any modern treatise on agriculture; all that I want you to note here is
  that this feeding function of the root is of a very delicate and
  discriminating kind, needing much searching and mining among the dust, to
  find what it wants. If it only wanted water, it could get most of that by
  spreading in mere soft senseless limbs, like sponge, as far, and as far
  down, as it could&mdash;but to get the <i>salt</i> out of the earth it
  has to <i>sift</i> all the earth, and taste and touch every grain of it
  that it can, with fine fibres. And therefore a root is not at all a
  merely passive sponge or absorbing thing, but an infinitely subtle
  tongue, or tasting and eating thing. That is why it is always so fibrous
  and divided and entangled in the clinging earth.</p>

  <p>9. "Always fibrous and divided"? But many roots are quite hard and
  solid!</p>

  <p>No; the active part of the root is always, I believe, a fibre. But
  there is often a provident and passive part&mdash;a savings bank of
  root&mdash;in which nourishment is laid up for the plant, and which,
  though it may be underground, is no <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span> more to be considered
  its real root than the kernel of a seed is. When you sow a pea, if you
  take it up in a day or two, you will find the fibre below, which is root;
  the shoot above, which is plant; and the pea as a now partly exhausted
  storehouse, looking very woful, and like the granaries of Paris after the
  fire. So, the round solid root of a cyclamen, or the conical one which
  you know so well as a carrot, are not properly roots, but permanent
  storehouses,&mdash;only the fibres that grow from them are roots. Then
  there are other apparent roots which are not even storehouses, but
  refuges; houses where the little plant lives in its infancy, through
  winter and rough weather. So that it will be best for you at once to
  limit your idea of a root to this,&mdash;that it is a group of growing
  fibres which taste and suck what is good for the plant out of the ground,
  and by their united strength hold it in its place; only remember the
  thick limbs of roots do not feed, but only the fine fibres at the ends of
  them which are something between tongues and sponges, and while they
  absorb moisture readily, are yet as particular about getting what they
  think nice to eat as any dainty little boy or girl; looking for it
  everywhere, and turning angry and sulky if they don't get it.</p>

  <p>10. But the root has, it seems to me, one more function, the most
  important of all. I say, it seems to me, for observe, what I have
  hitherto told you is all (I believe) ascertained and admitted; this that
  I am going to tell you has not yet, as far as I know, been asserted by
  men of <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>[33]</span> science, though I believe it to be
  demonstrable. But you are to examine into it, and think of it for
  yourself.</p>

  <p>There are some plants which appear to derive all their food from the
  air&mdash;which need nothing but a slight grasp of the ground to fix them
  in their place. Yet if we were to tie them into that place, in a
  framework, and cut them from their roots, they would die. Not only in
  these, but in all other plants, the vital power by which they shape and
  feed themselves, whatever that power may be, depends, I think, on that
  slight touch of the earth, and strange inheritance of its power. It is as
  essential to the plant's life as the connection of the head of an animal
  with its body by the spine is to the animal. Divide the feeble nervous
  thread, and all life ceases. Nay, in the tree the root is even of greater
  importance. You will not kill the tree, as you would an animal, by
  dividing its body or trunk. The part not severed from the root will shoot
  again. But in the root, and its touch of the ground, is the life of it.
  My own definition of a plant would be "a living creature whose source of
  vital energy is in the earth" (or in the water, as a form of the earth;
  that is, in inorganic substance). There is, however, one tribe of plants
  which seems nearly excepted from this law. It is a very strange one,
  having long been noted for the resemblance of its flowers to different
  insects; and it has recently been proved by Mr. Darwin to be dependent on
  insects for its existence. Doubly strange therefore, it seems, that in
  some cases this race of plants all but reaches the independent life of
  <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>[34]</span>
  insects. It rather <i>settles</i> upon boughs than roots itself in them;
  half of its roots may wave in the air.</p>

  <p>11. What vital power is, men of science are not a step nearer knowing
  than they were four thousand years ago. They are, if anything, farther
  from knowing now than then, in that they imagine themselves nearer. But
  they know more about its limitations and manifestations than they did.
  They have even arrived at something like a proof that there is a fixed
  quantity of it flowing out of things and into them. But, for the present,
  rest content with the general and sure knowledge that, fixed or flowing,
  measurable or immeasurable&mdash;one with electricity or heat or light,
  or quite distinct from any of them&mdash;life is a delightful, and its
  negative, death, a dreadful thing, to human creatures; and that you can
  give or gather a certain quantity of life into plants, animals, and
  yourself by wisdom and courage, and by their reverses can bring upon them
  any quantity of death you please, which is a much more serious point for
  you to consider than what life and death are.</p>

  <p>12. Now, having got a quite clear idea of a root properly so called,
  we may observe what those storehouses, refuges, and ruins are, which we
  find connected with roots. The greater number of plants feed and grow at
  the same time; but there are some of them which like to feed first and
  grow afterwards. For the first year, or, at all events, the first period
  of their life, they gather material for their future life out of the
  ground and out <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span> of the air, and lay it up in a storehouse
  as bees make combs. Of these stores&mdash;for the most part rounded
  masses tapering downwards into the ground&mdash;some are as good for
  human beings as honeycombs are; only not so sweet. We steal them from the
  plants, as we do from the bees, and these conical upside-down hives or
  treasuries of Atreus, under the names of carrots, turnips, and radishes,
  have had important influence on human fortunes. If we do not steal the
  store, next year the plant lives upon it, raises its stem, flowers and
  seeds out of that abundance, and having fulfilled its destiny, and
  provided for its successor, passes away, root and branch together.</p>

  <p>13. There is a pretty example of patience for us in this; and it would
  be well for young people generally to set themselves to grow in a
  carrotty or turnippy manner, and lay up secret store, not caring to
  exhibit it until the time comes for fruitful display. But they must not,
  in after-life, imitate the spendthrift vegetable, and blossom only in the
  strength of what they learned long ago; else they soon come to
  contemptible end. Wise people live like laurels and cedars, and go on
  mining in the earth, while they adorn and embalm the air.</p>

  <p>14. Secondly, Refuges. As flowers growing on trees have to live for
  some time, when they are young in their buds, so some flowers growing on
  the ground have to live for a while, when they are young, <i>in</i> what
  we call their <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>[36]</span> roots. These are mostly among the Drosidæ<a
  name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and other humble tribes,
  loving the ground; and, in their babyhood, liking to live quite down in
  it. A baby crocus has literally its own little dome&mdash;domus, or
  duomo&mdash;within which in early spring it lives a delicate convent life
  of its own, quite free from all worldly care and dangers, exceedingly
  ignorant of things in general, but itself brightly golden and perfectly
  formed before it is brought out. These subterranean palaces and vaulted
  cloisters, which we call bulbs, are no more roots than the blade of grass
  is a root, in which the ear of corn forms before it shoots up.</p>

  <p>15. Thirdly, Ruins. The flowers which have these subterranean homes
  form one of many families whose roots, as well as seeds, have the power
  of reproduction. The succession of some plants is trusted much to their
  seeds: a thistle sows itself by its down, an oak by its acorns; the
  companies of flying emigrants settle where they may; and the shadowy tree
  is content to cast down its showers of nuts for swines' food with the
  chance that here and there one may become a ship's bulwark. But others
  among plants are less careless, or less proud. Many are anxious for their
  children to grow in the place where they grew themselves, and secure this
  not merely by letting their fruit fall at their feet, on the chance of
  its growing up <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>[37]</span> beside them, but by closer bond, bud
  springing forth from root, and the young plant being animated by the
  gradually surrendered life of its parent. Sometimes the young root is
  formed above the old one, as in the crocus, or beside it, as in the
  amaryllis, or beside it in a spiral succession, as in the orchis; in
  these cases the old root always perishes wholly when the young one is
  formed; but in a far greater number of tribes, one root connects itself
  with another by a short piece of intermediate stem; and this stem does
  not at once perish when the new root is formed, but grows on at one end
  indefinitely, perishing slowly at the other, the scars or ruins of the
  past plants being long traceable on its sides. When it grows entirely
  underground it is called a root-stock. But there is no essential
  distinction between a root-stock and a creeping stem, only the root-stock
  may be thought of as a stem which shares the melancholy humour of a root
  in loving darkness, while yet it has enough consciousness of better
  things to grow towards, or near, the light. In one family it is even
  fragrant where the flower is not, and a simple houseleek is called
  'rhodiola rosea,' because its root-stock has the scent of a rose.</p>

  <p>16. There is one very unusual condition of the root-stock which has
  become of much importance in economy, though it is of little in botany;
  the forming, namely, of knots at the ends of the branches of the
  underground stem, where the new roots are to be thrown out. Of these
  knots, or 'tubers,' (swollen things,) one kind, belonging to <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[38]</span> the tobacco
  tribe, has been singularly harmful, together with its pungent relative,
  to a neighbouring country of ours, which perhaps may reach a higher
  destiny than any of its friends can conceive for it, if it can ever
  succeed in living without either the potato, or the pipe.</p>

  <p>17. Being prepared now to find among plants many things which are like
  roots, yet are not; you may simplify and make fast your true idea of a
  root as a fibre or group of fibres, which fixes, animates, and partly
  feeds the leaf. Then practically, as you examine plants in detail, ask
  first respecting them: What kind of root have they? Is it large or small
  in proportion to their bulk, and why is it so? What soil does it like,
  and what properties does it acquire from it? The endeavour to answer
  these questions will soon lead you to a rational inquiry into the plant's
  history. You will first ascertain what rock or earth it delights in, and
  what climate and circumstances; then you will see how its root is fitted
  to sustain it mechanically under given pressures and violences, and to
  find for it the necessary sustenance under given difficulties of famine
  or drought. Lastly you will consider what chemical actions appear to be
  going on in the root, or its store; what processes there are, and
  elements, which give pungency to the radish, flavour to the onion, or
  sweetness to the liquorice; and of what service each root may be made
  capable under cultivation, and by proper subsequent treatment, either to
  animals or men.</p>

  <p>18. I shall not attempt to do any of this for you; I <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span> assume, in
  giving this advice, that you wish to pursue the science of botany as your
  chief study; I have only broken moments for it, snatched from my chief
  occupations, and I have done nothing myself of all this I tell you to do.
  But so far as you can work in this manner, even if you only ascertain the
  history of one plant, so that you know that accurately, you will have
  helped to lay the foundation of a true science of botany, from which the

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE LEAF.</p>

  <p>1. In the first of the poems of which the English Government has
  appointed a portion to be sung every day for the instruction and pleasure
  of the people, there occurs this curious statement respecting any person
  who will behave himself rightly: "He shall be like a tree planted by the
  river side, that bears its fruit in its season. His leaf also shall not
  wither; and you will see that whatever he does will prosper."</p>

  <p>I call it a curious statement, because the conduct to which this
  prosperity is promised is not that which the English, as a nation, at
  present think conducive to prosperity: but whether the statement be true
  or not, it will be easy for you to recollect the two eastern figures
  under which the happiness of the man is represented,&mdash;that he is
  like a tree bearing fruit "in its season;" (not so hastily as that the
  frost pinch it, nor so late that no sun ripens it;) and that "his leaf
  shall not fade." I should like you to recollect this phrase in the
  Vulgate&mdash;"folium ejus non defluet"&mdash;shall not fall
  <i>away</i>,&mdash;that is to say, shall not fall so as to leave any
  visible bareness in winter time, but <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[41]</span> only that others may
  come up in its place, and the tree be always green.</p>

  <p><a name="c3p2"></a> 2. Now, you know, the fruit of the tree is either
  for the continuance of its race, or for the good, or harm, of other
  creatures. In no case is it a good to the tree itself. It is not indeed,
  properly, a part of the tree at all, any more than the egg is part of the
  bird, or the young of any creature part of the creature itself. But in
  the leaf is the strength of the tree itself. Nay, rightly speaking, the
  leaves <i>are</i> the tree itself. Its trunk sustains; its fruit burdens
  and exhausts; but in the leaf it breathes and lives. And thus also, in
  the eastern symbolism, the fruit is the labour of men for others; but the
  leaf is their own life. "He shall bring forth fruit, in his time; and his
  own joy and strength shall be continual."</p>

  <p>3. Notice next the word 'folium.' In Greek, <span title="phullon" class="grk"
  >&phi;&upsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span>, 'phyllon.'</p>

  <p>"The thing that is born," or "put forth." "When the branch is tender,
  and putteth forth her leaves, ye know that summer is nigh." The botanists
  say, "The leaf is an expansion of the bark of the stem." More accurately,
  the bark is a contraction of the tissue of the leaf. For every leaf is
  born out of the earth, and breathes out of the air; and there are many
  leaves that have no stems, but only roots. It is 'the springing thing';
  this thin film of life; rising, with its <i>edge</i> out of the
  ground&mdash;infinitely feeble, infinitely fair. With Folium, in Latin,
  is rightly associated the word Flos; for the flower is only a group of
  <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[42]</span>
  singularly happy leaves. From these two roots come foglio, feuille,
  feuillage, and fleur;&mdash;blume, blossom, and bloom; our foliage, and
  the borrowed foil, and the connected technical groups of words in
  architecture and the sciences.</p>

  <p>4. This <i>thin</i> film, I said. That is the essential character of a
  leaf; to be thin,&mdash;widely spread out in proportion to its mass. It
  is the opening of the substance of the earth to the air, which is the
  giver of life. The Greeks called it, therefore, not only the born or
  blooming thing, but the spread or expanded thing&mdash;"<span
  title="petalon" class="grk"
  >&pi;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span>." Pindar calls the
  beginnings of quarrel, "petals of quarrel." Recollect, therefore, this
  form, Petalos; and connect it with Petasos, the expanded cap of Mercury.
  For one great use of both is to give shade. The root of all these words
  is said to be <b><span title="PET" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&Epsilon;&Tau;</span></b> (Pet), which may easily be remembered in
  Greek, as it sometimes occurs in no unpleasant sense in English.</p>

  <p>5. But the word 'petalos' is connected in Greek with another word,
  meaning, to fly,&mdash;so that you may think of a bird as spreading its
  petals to the wind; and with another, signifying Fate in its pursuing
  flight, the overtaking thing, or overflying Fate. Finally, there is
  another Greek word meaning 'wide,' <span title="platus" class="grk"
  >&pi;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span> (platys); whence at
  last our 'plate'&mdash;a thing made broad or extended&mdash;but
  especially made broad or 'flat' out of the solid, as in a lump of clay
  extended on the wheel, or a lump of metal extended by the hammer. So the
  first we call Platter; the second Plate, when of the precious metals.
  Then putting <i>b</i> for <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>[43]</span> <i>p</i>, and <i>d</i> for <i>t</i>, we get
  the blade of an oar, and blade of grass.</p>

  <p>6. Now gather a branch of laurel, and look at it carefully. You may
  read the history of the being of half the earth in one of those green
  oval leaves&mdash;the things that the sun and the rivers have made out of
  dry ground. Daphne&mdash;daughter of Enipeus, and beloved by the
  Sun,&mdash;that fable gives you at once the two great facts about
  vegetation. Where warmth is, and moisture&mdash;there, also, the leaf.
  Where no warmth&mdash;there is no leaf; where there is no dew&mdash;no
  leaf.</p>

  <p>7. Look, then, to the branch you hold in your hand. That you
  <i>can</i> so hold it, or make a crown of it, if you choose, is the first
  thing I want you to note of it;&mdash;the proportion of size, namely,
  between the leaf and <i>you</i>. Great part of your life and character,
  as a human creature, has depended on that. Suppose all leaves had been
  spacious, like some palm leaves; solid, like cactus stem; or that trees
  had grown, as they might of course just as easily have grown, like
  mushrooms, all one great cluster of leaf round one stalk. I do not say
  that they are divided into small leaves only for your delight, or your
  service, as if you were the monarch of everything&mdash;even in this atom
  of a globe. You are made of your proper size; and the leaves of theirs:
  for reasons, and by laws, of which neither the leaves nor you know
  anything. Only note the harmony between both, and the joy we may have in
  this division and mystery of the frivolous and tremulous petals, <!--
  Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[44]</span> which
  break the light and the breeze,&mdash;compared to what with the frivolous
  and tremulous mind which is in us, we could have had out of domes, or
  penthouses, or walls of leaf.</p>

  <p>8. Secondly; think awhile of its dark clear green, and the good of it
  to you. Scientifically, you know green in leaves is owing to
  'chlorophyll,' or, in English, to 'greenleaf.' It may be very fine to
  know that; but my advice to you, on the whole, is to rest content with
  the general fact that leaves are green when they do not grow in or near
  smoky towns; and not by any means to rest content with the fact that very
  soon there will not be a green leaf in England, but only greenish-black
  ones. And thereon resolve that you will yourself endeavour to promote the
  growing of the green wood, rather than of the black.</p>

  <p>9. Looking at the back of your laurel-leaves, you see how the central
  rib or spine of each, and the lateral branchings, strengthen and carry
  it. I find much confused use, in botanical works, of the words Vein and
  Rib. For, indeed, there are veins <i>in</i> the ribs of leaves, as marrow
  in bones; and the projecting bars often gradually depress themselves into
  a transparent net of rivers. But the <i>mechanical</i> force of the
  framework in carrying the leaf-tissue is the point first to be noticed;
  it is that which admits, regulates, or restrains the visible motions of
  the leaf; while the system of circulation can only be studied through the
  microscope. But the ribbed leaf bears itself to the wind, as the webbed
  foot of a bird does to the <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>[45]</span> water, and needs the same kind, though not
  the same strength, of support; and its ribs always are partly therefore
  constituted of strong woody substance, which is knit out of the tissue;
  and you can extricate this skeleton framework, and keep it, after the
  leaf-tissue is dissolved. So I shall henceforward speak simply of the
  leaf and its ribs,&mdash;only specifying the additional veined structure
  on necessary occasions.</p>

  <p>10. I have just said that the ribs&mdash;and might have said, farther,
  the stalk that sustains them&mdash;are knit out of the <i>tissue</i> of
  the leaf. But what is the leaf tissue itself knit out of? One would think
  that was nearly the first thing to be discovered, or at least to be
  thought of, concerning plants,&mdash;namely, how and of what they are
  made. We say they 'grow.' But you know that they can't grow out of
  nothing;&mdash;this solid wood and rich tracery must be made out of some
  previously existing substance. What is the substance?&mdash;and how is it
  woven into leaves.&mdash;twisted into wood?</p>

  <p>11. Consider how fast this is done, in spring. You walk in February
  over a slippery field, where, through hoar-frost and mud, you perhaps
  hardly see the small green blades of trampled turf. In twelve weeks you
  wade through the same field up to your knees in fresh grass; and in a
  week or two more, you mow two or three solid haystacks off it. In winter
  you walk by your currant-bush, or your vine. They are shrivelled
  sticks&mdash;like bits of black tea in the canister. You pass again in
  May, and <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>[46]</span> the currant-bush looks like a young
  sycamore tree; and the vine is a bower: and meanwhile the forests, all
  over this side of the round world, have grown their foot or two in
  height, with new leaves&mdash;so much deeper, so much denser than they
  were. Where has it all come from? Cut off the fresh shoots from a single
  branch of any tree in May. Weigh them; and then consider that so much
  weight has been added to every such living branch, everywhere, this side
  the equator, within the last two months. What is all that made of?</p>

  <p>12. Well, this much the botanists really know, and tell us,&mdash;It
  is made chiefly of the breath of animals: that is to say, of the
  substance which, during the past year, animals have breathed into the
  air; and which, if they went on breathing, and their breath were not made
  into trees, would poison them, or rather suffocate them, as people are
  suffocated in uncleansed pits, and dogs in the Grotta del Cane. So that
  you may look upon the grass and forests of the earth as a kind of green
  hoar-frost, frozen upon it from our breath, as, on the window-panes, the
  white arborescence of ice.</p>

  <p>13. But how is it made into wood?</p>

  <p>The substances that have been breathed into the air are charcoal, with
  oxygen and hydrogen,&mdash;or, more plainly, charcoal and water. Some
  necessary earths,&mdash;in smaller quantity, but absolutely
  essential,&mdash;the trees get from the ground; but, I believe all the
  charcoal they want, and most of the water, from the air. Now the question
  is, where and how do they take it in, and digest it into wood? <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span></p>

  <p>14. You know, in spring, and partly through all the year, except in
  frost, a liquid called 'sap' circulates in trees, of which the nature,
  one should have thought, might have been ascertained by mankind in the
  six thousand years they have been cutting wood. Under the impression
  always that it <i>had been</i> ascertained, and that I could at any time
  know all about it, I have put off till to-day, 19th October, 1869, when I
  am past fifty, the knowing anything about it at all. But I will really
  endeavour now to ascertain something, and take to my botanical books,
  accordingly, in due order.</p>

  <p>(1) Dresser's "Rudiments of Botany." 'Sap' not in the index; only
  Samara, and Sarcocarp,&mdash;about neither of which I feel the smallest
  curiosity. (2) Figuier's "Histoire des Plantes."<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> 'Sêve,' not in index; only Serpolet,
  and Sherardia arvensis, which also have no help in them for me. (3)
  Balfour's "Manual of Botany." 'Sap,'&mdash;yes, at last. "Article 257.
  Course of fluids in exogenous stems." I don't care about the course just
  now: I want to know where the fluids come from. "If a plant be plunged
  into a weak solution of acetate of lead,"&mdash;I don't in the least want
  to know what happens. "From the minuteness of the tissue, it is not easy
  to determine the vessels through which the sap moves." Who said it was?
  If it had been easy, I should have done it myself. "Changes take place in
  the composition of the <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>[48]</span> sap in its upward course." I dare say; but
  I don't know yet what its composition is before it begins going up. "The
  Elaborated Sap by Mr. Schultz has been called 'latex.'" I wish Mr.
  Schultz were in a hogshead of it, with the top on. "On account of these
  movements in the latex, the laticiferous vessels have been denominated
  cinenchymatous." I do not venture to print the expressions which I here
  mentally make use of.</p>

  <p>15. Stay,&mdash;here, at last, in Article 264, is something to the
  purpose: "It appears then that, in the case of Exogenous plants, the
  fluid matter in the soil, containing different substances in solution, is
  sucked up by the extremities of the roots." Yes, but how of the pine
  trees on yonder rock?&mdash;Is there any sap in the rock, or water
  either? The moisture must be seized during actual rain on the root, or
  stored up from the snow; stored up, any way, in a tranquil, not actively
  sappy, state, till the time comes for its change, of which there is no
  account here.</p>

  <p>16. I have only one chance left now. Lindley's "Introduction to
  Botany." 'Sap,'&mdash;yes,&mdash;'General motion of.' II. 325. "The
  course which is taken by the sap, after entering a plant, is the first
  subject for consideration." My dear doctor, I have learned nearly
  whatever I know of plant structure from you, and am grateful; and that it
  is little, is not your fault, but mine. But this&mdash;let me say it with
  all sincere respect&mdash;is not what you should have told me here. You
  know, far better than I, that 'sap' never does enter a plant at all; but
  only salt, or earth and water, <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>[49]</span> and that the roots alone could not make it;
  and that, therefore, the course of it must be, in great part, the result
  or process of the actual making. But I will read now, patiently; for I
  know you will tell me much that is worth hearing, though not perhaps what
  I want.</p>

  <p>Yes; now that I have read Lindley's statement carefully, I find it is
  full of precious things; and this is what, with thinking over it, I can
  gather for you.</p>

  <p>17. First, towards the end of January,&mdash;as the light enlarges,
  and the trees revive from their rest,&mdash;there is a general
  liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius in their stems; and I suppose
  there is really a great deal of moisture rapidly absorbed from the earth
  in most cases; and that this absorption is a great help to the sun in
  drying the winter's damp out of it for us: then, with that strange vital
  power,&mdash;which scientific people are usually as afraid of naming as
  common people are afraid of naming Death,&mdash;the tree gives the
  gathered earth and water a changed existence; and to this new-born liquid
  an upward motion from the earth, as our blood has from the heart; for the
  life of the tree is out of the earth; and this upward motion has a
  mechanical power in pushing on the growth. "<i>Forced onward</i> by the
  current of sap, the plumule ascends," (Lindley, p. 132,)&mdash;this blood
  of the tree having to supply, exactly as our own blood has, not only the
  forming powers of substance, but a continual evaporation, "approximately
  seventeen times more than that of the human body," while the force of
  motion in the sap "is <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>[50]</span> sometimes five times greater than that
  which impels the blood in the crural artery of the horse."</p>

  <p>18. Hence generally, I think we may conclude thus much,&mdash;that at
  every pore of its surface, under ground and above, the plant in the
  spring absorbs moisture, which instantly disperses itself through its
  whole system "by means of some permeable quality of the membranes of the
  cellular tissue invisible to our eyes even by the most powerful glasses"
  (p. 326); that in this way subjected to the vital power of the tree, it
  becomes sap, properly so called, which passes downwards through this
  cellular tissue, slowly and secretly; and then upwards, through the great
  vessels of the tree, violently, stretching out the supple twigs of it as
  yon see a flaccid waterpipe swell and move when the cock is turned to
  fill it. And the tree becomes literally a fountain, of which the
  springing streamlets are clothed with new-woven garments of green tissue,
  and of which the silver spray stays in the sky,&mdash;a spray, now, of
  leaves.</p>

  <p>19. That is the gist of the matter; and a very wonderful gist it is,
  to my mind. The secret and subtle descent&mdash;the violent and exulting
  resilience of the tree's blood,&mdash;what guides it?&mdash;what compels?
  The creature has no heart to beat like ours; one cannot take refuge from
  the mystery in a 'muscular contraction.' Fountain without
  supply&mdash;playing by its own force, for ever rising and falling all
  through the days of Spring, spending itself at last in gathered clouds of
  leaves, and iris of blossom.</p>

  <p>Very wonderful; and it seems, for the present, that <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[51]</span> we know nothing
  whatever about its causes;&mdash;nay, the strangeness of the reversed
  arterial and vein motion, without a heart, does not seem to strike
  anybody. Perhaps, however, it may interest you, as I observe it does the
  botanists, to know that the cellular tissue through which the motion is
  effected is called Parenchym, and the woody tissue, Bothrenchym; and that
  Parenchym is divided, by a system of nomenclature which "has some
  advantages over that more commonly in use,"<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> into merenchyma, conenchyma, ovenchyma,
  atractenchyma, cylindrenchyma, colpenchyma, cladenchyma, and
  prismenchyma.</p>

  <p>20. Take your laurel branch into your hand again. There are, as you
  must well know, innumerable shapes and orders of leaves;&mdash;there are
  some like claws; some like fingers, and some like feet; there are
  endlessly cleft ones, and endlessly clustered ones, and inscrutable
  divisions within divisions of the fretted verdure; and wrinkles, and
  ripples, and stitchings, and hemmings, and pinchings, and gatherings, and
  crumplings, and clippings, and what not. But there is nothing so
  constantly noble as the pure leaf of the laurel, bay, orange, and olive;
  numerable, sequent, perfect in setting, divinely simple and serene. I
  shall call these noble leaves 'Apolline' leaves. They characterize many
  orders of plants, great and small,&mdash;from the magnolia to the myrtle,
  and exquisite 'myrtille' <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page52"></a>[52]</span> of the hills, (bilberry); but wherever you
  find them, strong, lustrous, dark green, simply formed, richly scented or
  stored,&mdash;you have nearly always kindly and lovely vegetation, in
  healthy ground and air.</p>

  <p>21. The gradual diminution in rank beneath the Apolline leaf, takes
  place in others by the loss of one or more of the qualities above named.
  The Apolline leaf, I said, is strong, lustrous, full in its green, rich
  in substance, simple in form. The inferior leaves are those which have
  lost strength, and become thin, like paper; which have lost lustre, and
  become dead by roughness of surface, like the nettle,&mdash;(an Apolline
  leaf may become dead by <i>bloom</i>, like the olive, yet not lose
  beauty); which have lost colour and become feeble in green, as in the
  poplar, or <i>crudely</i> bright, like rice; which have lost substance
  and softness, and have nothing to give in scent or nourishment; or become
  flinty or spiny; finally, which have lost simplicity, and become cloven
  or jagged. Many of these losses are partly atoned for by gain of some
  peculiar loveliness. Grass and moss, and parsley and fern, have each
  their own delightfulness; yet they are all of inferior power and honour,
  compared to the Apolline leaves.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/fig3.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig3.png"
      alt="Fig. 3. Leaves of elm and alisma." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 3.
  </div>
  <p>22. You see, however, that though your laurel leaf has a central stem,
  and traces of ribs branching from it, in a vertebrated manner, they are
  so faint that we cannot take it for a type of vertebrate structure. But
  the two figures of elm and alisma leaf, given in Modern Painters (vol.
  iii.), and now here repeated, Fig. 3, will clearly enough <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span> show the
  opposition between this vertebrate form, branching again usually at the
  edges, <i>a</i>, and the softly opening lines diffused at the stem, and
  gathered at the point of the leaf <i>b</i>, which, as you almost without
  doubt know already are characteristic of a vast group of plants,
  including especially all the lilies, grasses, and palms, which for the
  most part are the signs of local or temporary moisture in hot
  countries;&mdash;local, as of fountains and streams; temporary, as of
  rain or inundation.</p>

  <p>But temporary, still more definitely in the day, than in the year.
  When you go out, delighted, into the dew of the morning, have you ever
  considered why it is so rich upon the grass;&mdash;why it is <i>not</i>
  upon the trees? It <i>is</i> partly on the trees, but yet your memory of
  it will be always chiefly of its gleam upon the lawn. On many <!-- Page
  54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>[54]</span> trees you
  will find there is none at all. I cannot follow out here the many
  inquiries connected with this subject, but, broadly, remember the
  branched trees are fed chiefly by rain,&mdash;the unbranched ones by dew,
  visible or invisible; that is to say, at all events by moisture which
  they can gather for themselves out of the air; or else by streams and
  springs. Hence the division of the verse of the song of Moses: "My
  doctrine shall drop as the rain; my speech shall distil as the dew: as
  the <i>small</i> rain upon the tender <i>herb</i>, and as the showers
  upon the grass."</p>

  <p>23. Next, examining the direction of the veins in the leaf of the
  alisma, <i>b</i>, Fig. 3, you see they all open widely, as soon as they
  can, towards the thick part of the leaf; and then taper, apparently with
  reluctance, pushing each other outwards, to the point. If the leaf were a
  lake of the same shape, and its stem the entering river, the lines of the
  currents passing through it would, I believe, be nearly the same as that
  of the veins in the aquatic leaf. I have not examined the fluid law
  accurately, and I do not suppose there is more real correspondence than
  may be caused by the leaf's expanding in every permitted direction, as
  the water would, with all the speed it can; but the resemblance is so
  close as to enable you to fasten the relation of the unbranched leaves to
  streams more distinctly in your mind,&mdash;just as the toss of the palm
  leaves from their stem may, I think, in their likeness to the springing
  of a fountain, remind you of their relation to the desert, and their
  necessity, therein, to life of man and beast. <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>[55]</span></p>

  <p>24. And thus, associating these grass and lily leaves always with
  fountains, or with dew, I think we may get a pretty general name for them
  also. You know that Cora, our Madonna of the flowers, was lost in
  Sicilian Fields: you know, also, that the fairest of Greek fountains,
  lost in Greece, was thought to rise in a Sicilian islet; and that the
  real springing of the noble fountain in that rock was one of the causes
  which determined the position of the greatest Greek city of Sicily. So I
  think, as we call the fairest branched leaves 'Apolline,' we will call
  the fairest flowing ones 'Arethusan.' But remember that the Apolline leaf
  represents only the central type of land leaves, and is, within certain
  limits, of a fixed form; while the beautiful Arethusan leaves, alike in
  flowing of their lines, change their forms indefinitely,&mdash;some
  shaped like round pools, and some like winding currents, and many like
  arrows, and many like hearts, and otherwise varied and variable, as
  leaves ought to be,&mdash;that rise out of the waters, and float amidst
  the pausing of their foam.</p>

  <p>25. Brantwood, <i>Easter Day</i>, 1875.&mdash;I don't like to spoil my
  pretty sentence, above; but on reading it over, I suspect I wrote it
  confusing the water-lily leaf, and other floating ones of the same kind,
  with the Arethusan forms. But the water-lily and water-ranunculus leaves,
  and such others, are to the orders of earth-loving leaves what ducks and
  swans are to birds; (the swan is the water-lily of birds;) they are
  <i>swimming</i> leaves; not properly watery creatures, or able to live
  under water like fish, (unless <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>[56]</span> when dormant), but just like birds that
  pass their lives on the surface of the waves&mdash;though they must
  breathe in the air.</p>

  <p>And these natant leaves, as they lie on the water surface, do not want
  strong ribs to carry them,<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> but have very delicate ones beautifully
  branching into the orbed space, to keep the tissue nice and flat; while,
  on the other hand, leaves that really have to grow under water, sacrifice
  their tissue, and keep only their ribs, like coral animals; ('Ranunculus
  heterophyllus,' 'other-leaved Frog-flower,' and its like,) just as, if
  you keep your own hands too long in water, they shrivel at the
  finger-ends.</p>

  <p>26. So that you must not attach any great botanical importance to the
  characters of contrasted aspects in leaves, which I wish you to express
  by the words 'Apolline' and 'Arethusan'; but their mythic importance is
  very great, and your careful observance of it will help you completely to
  understand the beautiful Greek fable of Apollo and Daphne. There are
  indeed several Daphnes, and the first root of the name is far away in
  another field of thought altogether, connected with the Gods of Light.
  But etymology, the best of servants, is an unreasonable master; and
  Professor Max Müller trusts his deep-reaching knowledge of the first
  ideas connected with the names of Athena <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[57]</span> and Daphne, too
  implicitly, when he supposes this idea to be retained in central Greek
  theology. 'Athena' originally meant only the dawn, among nations who knew
  nothing of a Sacred Spirit. But the Athena who catches Achilles by the
  hair, and urges the spear of Diomed, has not, in the mind of Homer, the
  slightest remaining connection with the mere beauty of daybreak. Daphne
  chased by Apollo, may perhaps&mdash;though I doubt even this much of
  consistence in the earlier myth&mdash;have meant the Dawn pursued by the
  Sun. But there is no trace whatever of this first idea left in the fable
  of Arcadia and Thessaly.</p>

  <p>27. The central Greek Daphne is the daughter of one of the great
  <i>river</i> gods of Arcadia; her mother is the Earth. Now Arcadia is the
  Oberland of Greece; and the crests of Cyllene, Erymanthus, and Mænalus<a
  name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> surround it, like the
  Swiss forest cantons, with walls of rock, and shadows of pine. And it
  divides itself, like the Oberland, into three regions: first, the region
  of rock and snow, sacred to Mercury and Apollo, in which Mercury's birth
  on Cyllene, his construction of the lyre, and his stealing the oxen of
  Apollo, are all expressions of the enchantments of cloud and sound,
  mingling with the sunshine, on the cliffs of Cyllene.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16hg3">"While the mists</p>
      <p>Flying, and rainy vapours, call out shapes</p>
<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[58]</span>
      <p>And phantoms from the crags and solid earth</p>
      <p>As fast as a musician scatters sounds</p>
      <p>Out of his instrument."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Then came the pine region, sacred especially to Pan and Mænalus, the
  son of Lycaon and brother of Callisto; and you had better remember this
  relationship carefully, for the sake of the meaning of the constellations
  of Ursa Major and the Mons Mænalius, and of their wolf and bear
  traditions; (compare also the strong impression on the Greek mind of the
  wild leafiness, nourished by snow, of the B&oelig;otian
  Cithæron,&mdash;"Oh, thou lake-hollow, full of divine leaves, and of wild
  creatures, nurse of the snow, darling of Diana," (Ph&oelig;nissæ, 801)).
  How wild the climate of this pine region is, you may judge from the
  pieces in the note below<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> out of Colonel Leake's diary in <!--
  Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>[59]</span>
  crossing the Mænalian range in spring. And then, lastly, you have the
  laurel and vine region, full of sweetness and Elysian beauty.</p>

  <p>28. Now as Mercury is the ruling power of the hill enchantment, so
  Daphne of the leafy peace. She is, in her first life, the daughter of the
  mountain river, the mist of it filling the valley; the Sun, pursuing, and
  effacing it, from dell to dell, is, literally, Apollo pursuing Daphne,
  and <i>adverse</i> to her; (not, as in the earlier tradition, the Sun
  pursuing only his own light). Daphne, thus hunted, cries to her mother,
  the Earth, which opens, and receives her, causing the laurel to spring up
  in her stead. That is to say, wherever the rocks protect the mist from
  the sunbeam, and suffer it to water the earth, there the laurel and other
  richest vegetation fill the hollows, giving a better glory to the sun
  itself. For sunshine, on the torrent spray, <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span> on the grass of its
  valley, and entangled among the laurel stems, or glancing from their
  leaves, became a thousandfold lovelier and more sacred than the same
  sunbeams, burning on the leafless mountain-side.</p>

  <p>And farther, the leaf, in its connection with the river, is typically
  expressive, not, as the flower was, of human fading and passing away, but
  of the perpetual flow and renewal of human mind and thought, rising "like
  the rivers that run among the hills"; therefore it was that the youth of
  Greece sacrificed their hair&mdash;the sign of their continually renewed
  strength,&mdash;to the rivers, and to Apollo. Therefore, to commemorate
  Apollo's own chief victory over death&mdash;over Python, the
  corrupter,&mdash;a laurel branch was gathered every ninth year in the
  vale of Tempe; and the laurel leaf became the reward or crown of all
  beneficent and enduring work of man&mdash;work of inspiration, born of
  the strength of the earth, and of the dew of heaven, and which can never
  pass away.</p>

  <p>29. You may doubt at first, even because of its grace, this meaning in
  the fable of Apollo and Daphne; you will not doubt it, however, when you
  trace it back to its first eastern origin. When we speak carelessly of
  the traditions respecting the Garden of Eden, (or in Hebrew, remember,
  Garden of Delight,) we are apt to confuse Milton's descriptions with
  those in the book of Genesis. Milton fills his Paradise with flowers; but
  no flowers are spoken of in Genesis. We may indeed conclude that in
  speaking of every herb of the field, flowers are included. But they <!--
  Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span> are not
  named. The things that are <i>named</i> in the Garden of Delight are
  trees only.</p>

  <p>The words are, "every tree that was pleasant to the sight and good for
  food;" and as if to mark the idea more strongly for us in the Septuagint,
  even the ordinary Greek word for tree is not used, but the word <span
  title="xulon" class="grk"
  >&xi;&upsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span>,&mdash;literally, every
  'wood,' every piece of <i>timber</i> that was pleasant or good. They are
  indeed the "vivi travi,"&mdash;living rafters, of Dante's Apennine.</p>

  <p>Do you remember how those trees were said to be watered? Not by the
  four rivers only. The rivers could not supply the place of rain. No
  rivers do; for in truth they are the refuse of rain. No storm-clouds were
  there, nor hidings of the blue by darkening veil; but there went up a
  <i>mist</i> from the earth, and watered the face of the ground,&mdash;or,
  as in Septuagint and Vulgate, "There went forth a fountain from the
  earth, and gave the earth to drink."</p>

  <p>30. And now, lastly, we continually think of that Garden of Delight,
  as if it existed, or could exist, no longer; wholly forgetting that it is
  spoken of in Scripture as perpetually existent; and some of its fairest
  trees as existent also, or only recently destroyed. When Ezekiel is
  describing to Pharaoh the greatness of the Assyrians, do you remember
  what image he gives of them? "Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in
  Lebanon, with fair branches; and his top was among the thick boughs; the
  waters nourished him, and the deep brought him up, with her rivers <!--
  Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>[62]</span> running
  round about his plants. Under his branches did all the beasts of the
  field bring forth their young; and under his shadow dwelt all great
  nations."</p>

  <p>31. Now hear what follows. "The cedars <i>in the Garden of God</i>
  could not hide <i>him</i>. The fir trees were not like his boughs, and
  the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the Garden
  of God was like unto him in beauty."</p>

  <p>So that you see, whenever a nation rises into consistent, vital, and,
  through many generations, enduring power, <i>there</i> is still the
  Garden of God; still it is the water of life which feeds the roots of it;
  and still the succession of its people is imaged by the perennial leafage
  of trees of Paradise. Could this be said of Assyria, and shall it <span
  class="correction" title="'no' in original">not</span> be said of
  England? How much more, of lives such as ours should be,&mdash;just,
  laborious, united in aim, <span class="correction" title="'benet ficent' across 2 lines in original"
  >beneficent</span> in fulfilment, may the image be used of the leaves of
  the trees of Eden! Other symbols have been given often to show the
  evanescence and slightness of our lives&mdash;the foam upon the water,
  the grass on the housetop, the vapour that vanishes away; yet none of
  these are images of true human life. That life, when it is real, is
  <i>not</i> evanescent; is <i>not</i> slight; does <i>not</i> vanish away.
  Every noble life leaves the fibre of it interwoven for ever in the work
  of the world; by so much, evermore, the strength of the human race has
  gained; more stubborn in the root, higher towards heaven in the branch;
  and, "as a teil tree, and as an oak,&mdash;whose substance is in them
  <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>[63]</span>
  when they cast their leaves,&mdash;so the holy seed is in the midst
  thereof."</p>

  <p>32. Only remember on what conditions. In the great Psalm of life, we
  are told that everything that a man doeth shall prosper, so only that he
  delight in the law of his God, that he hath not walked in the counsel of
  the wicked, nor sat in the seat of the scornful. Is it among these leaves
  of the perpetual Spring,&mdash;helpful leaves for the healing of the
  nations,&mdash;that we mean to have our part and place, or rather among
  the "brown skeletons of leaves that lag, the forest brook along"? For
  other leaves there are, and other streams that water them,&mdash;not
  water of life, but water of Acheron. Autumnal leaves there are that strew
  the brooks, in Vallombrosa. Remember you how the name of the place was
  changed: "Once called 'Sweet water' (Aqua bella), now, the Shadowy Vale."
  Portion in one or other name we must choose, all of us,&mdash;with the
  living olive, by the living fountains of waters, or with the wild fig
  trees, whose leafage of human soul is strewed along the brooks of death,
  in the eternal Vallombrosa.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE FLOWER.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Rome</span>, <i>Whit Monday, 1874</i>.

  <p>1. On the quiet road leading from under the Palatine to the little
  church of St. Nereo and Achilleo, I met, yesterday morning, group after
  group of happy peasants heaped in pyramids on their triumphal carts, in
  Whit-Sunday dress, stout and clean, and gay in colour; and the women all
  with bright artificial roses in their hair, set with true natural taste,
  and well becoming them. This power of arranging wreath or crown of
  flowers for the head, remains to the people from classic times. And the
  thing that struck me most in the look of it was not so much the
  cheerfulness, as the dignity;&mdash;in a true sense, the
  <i>becomingness</i> and decorousness of the ornament. Among the ruins of
  the dead city, and the worse desolation of the work of its modern
  rebuilders, here was one element at least of honour, and
  order;&mdash;and, in these, of delight.</p>

  <p>And these are the real significances of the flower itself. It is the
  utmost purification of the plant, and the utmost discipline. Where its
  tissue is blanched fairest, dyed purest, set in strictest rank, appointed
  to most chosen office, <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[65]</span> there&mdash;and created by the fact of this
  purity and function&mdash;is the flower.</p>

  <p>2. But created, observe, by the purity and order, more than by the
  function. The flower exists for its own sake,&mdash;not for the fruit's
  sake. The production of the fruit is an added honour to it&mdash;is a
  granted consolation to us for its death. But the flower is the end of the
  seed,&mdash;not the seed of the flower. You are fond of cherries,
  perhaps; and think that the use of cherry blossom is to produce cherries.
  Not at all. The use of cherries is to produce cherry blossoms; just as
  the use of bulbs is to produce hyacinths,&mdash;not of hyacinths to
  produce bulbs. Nay, that the flower can multiply by bulb, or root, or
  slip, as well as by seed, may show you at once how immaterial the
  seed-forming function is to the flower's existence. A flower is to the
  vegetable substance what a crystal is to the mineral. "Dust of sapphire,"
  writes my friend Dr. John Brown to me, of the wood hyacinths of Scotland
  in the spring. Yes, that is so,&mdash;each bud more beautiful, itself,
  than perfectest jewel&mdash;<i>this</i>, indeed, jewel "of purest ray
  serene;" but, observe you, the glory is in the purity, the serenity, the
  radiance,&mdash;not in the mere continuance of the creature.</p>

  <p>3. It is because of its beauty that its continuance is worth Heaven's
  while. The glory of it is in being,&mdash;not in begetting; and in the
  spirit and substance,&mdash;not the change. For the earth also has its
  flesh and spirit. Every day of spring is the earth's Whit
  Sunday&mdash;Fire <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>[66]</span> Sunday. The falling fire of the rainbow,
  with the order of its zones, and the gladness of its covenant,&mdash;you
  may eat of it, like Esdras; but you feed upon it only that you may see
  it. Do you think that flowers were born to nourish the blind?</p>

  <p>Fasten well in your mind, then, the conception of order, and purity,
  as the essence of the flower's being, no less than of the crystal's. A
  ruby is not made bright to scatter round it child-rubies; nor a flower,
  but in collateral and added honour, to give birth to other flowers.</p>

  <p>Two main facts, then, you have to study in every flower: the symmetry
  or order of it, and the perfection of its substance; first, the manner in
  which the leaves are placed for beauty of form; then the spinning and
  weaving and blanching of their tissue, for the reception of purest
  colour, or refining to richest surface.</p>

  <p>4. First, the order: the proportion, and answering to each other, of
  the parts; for the study of which it becomes necessary to know what its
  parts are; and that a flower consists essentially of&mdash;Well, I really
  don't know what it consists essentially of. For some flowers have bracts,
  and stalks, and toruses, and calices, and corollas, and discs, and
  stamens, and pistils, and ever so many odds and ends of things besides,
  of no use at all, seemingly; and others have no bracts, and no stalks,
  and no toruses, and no calices, and no corollas, and nothing recognizable
  for stamens or pistils,&mdash;only, when they come to be reduced to this
  kind of poverty, one doesn't call <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span> them flowers; they get
  together in knots, and one calls them catkins, or the like, or forgets
  their existence altogether;&mdash;I haven't the least idea, for instance,
  myself, what an oak blossom is like; only I know its bracts get together
  and make a cup of themselves afterwards, which the Italians call, as they
  do the dome of St. Peter's, 'cupola'; and that it is a great pity, for
  their own sake as well as the world's, that they were not content with
  their ilex cupolas, which were made to hold something, but took to
  building these big ones upside-down, which hold nothing&mdash;<i>less</i>
  than nothing,&mdash;large extinguishers of the flame of Catholic
  religion. And for farther embarrassment, a flower not only is without
  essential consistence of a given number of parts, but it rarely consists,
  alone, of <i>itself</i>. One talks of a hyacinth as of a flower; but a
  hyacinth is any number of flowers. One does not talk of 'a heather'; when
  one says 'heath,' one means the whole plant, not the
  blossom,&mdash;because heath-bells, though they grow together for
  company's sake, do so in a voluntary sort of way, and are not fixed in
  their places; and yet, they depend on each other for effect, as much as a
  bunch of grapes.</p>

  <p>5. And this grouping of flowers, more or less waywardly, is the most
  subtle part of their order, and the most difficult to represent. Take
  that cluster of bog-heather bells, for instance, Line-study 1. You might
  think at first there were no lines in it worth study; but look at it more
  carefully. There are twelve bells in the <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[68]</span> cluster. There may be
  fewer, or more; but the bog-heath is apt to run into something near that
  number. They all grow together as close as they can, and on one side of
  the supporting branch only. The natural effect would be to bend the
  branch down; but the branch won't have that, and so leans back to carry
  them. Now you see the use of drawing the profile in the middle figure: it
  shows you the exactly balanced setting of the group,&mdash;not drooping,
  nor erect; but with a disposition to droop, tossed up by the leaning back
  of the stem. Then, growing as near as they can to each other, those in
  the middle get squeezed. Here is another quite special character. Some
  flowers don't like being squeezed at all (fancy a squeezed convolvulus!);
  but these heather bells like it, and look all the prettier for
  it,&mdash;not the squeezed ones exactly, by themselves, but the cluster
  altogether, by their patience.</p>

  <p>Then also the outside ones get pushed into a sort of star-shape, and
  in front show the colour of all their sides, and at the back the rich
  green cluster of sharp leaves that hold them; all this order being as
  essential to the plant as any of the more formal structures of the bell
  itself.</p>

  <p>6. But the bog-heath has usually only one cluster of flowers to
  arrange on each branch. Take a spray of ling (Frontispiece), and you will
  find that the richest piece of Gothic spire-sculpture would be dull and
  graceless beside the grouping of the floral masses in their various life.
  But it is difficult to give the accuracy of attention <!-- Page 69
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[69]</span> necessary to
  see their beauty without drawing them; and still more difficult to draw
  them in any approximation to the truth before they change. This is indeed
  the fatallest obstacle to all good botanical work. Flowers, or
  leaves,&mdash;and especially the last,&mdash;can only be rightly drawn as
  they grow. And even then, in their loveliest spring action, they grow as
  you draw them, and will not stay quite the same creatures for half an
  hour.</p>

  <p>7. I said in my inaugural lectures at Oxford, § 107, that real botany
  is not so much the description of plants as their biography. Without
  entering at all into the history of its fruitage, the life and death of
  the blossom <i>itself</i> is always an eventful romance, which must be
  completely told, if well. The grouping given to the various states of
  form between bud and flower is always the most important part of the
  design of the plant; and in the modes of its death are some of the most
  touching lessons, or symbolisms, connected with its existence. The utter
  loss and far-scattered ruin of the cistus and wild rose,&mdash;the
  dishonoured and dark contortion of the convolvulus,&mdash;the pale
  wasting of the crimson heath of Apennine, are strangely opposed by the
  quiet closing of the brown bells of the ling, each making of themselves a
  little cross as they die; and so enduring into the days of winter. I have
  drawn the faded beside the full branch, and know not which is the more
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>8. This grouping, then, and way of treating each other in their
  gathered company, is the first and most subtle <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[70]</span> condition of form in
  flowers; and, observe, I don't mean, just now, the appointed and
  disciplined grouping, but the wayward and accidental. Don't confuse the
  beautiful consent of the cluster in these sprays of heath with the legal
  strictness of a foxglove,&mdash;though that also has its divinity; but of
  another kind. That legal order of blossoming&mdash;for which we may
  wisely keep the accepted name, 'inflorescence,'&mdash;is itself quite a
  separate subject of study, which we cannot take up until we know the
  still more strict laws which are set over the flower itself.</p>

  <p>9. I have in my hand a small red poppy which I gathered on Whit Sunday
  on the palace of the Cæsars. It is an intensely simple, intensely floral,
  flower. All silk and flame: a scarlet cup, perfect-edged all round, seen
  among the wild grass far away, like a burning coal fallen from Heaven's
  altars. You cannot have a more complete, a more stainless, type of flower
  absolute; inside and outside, <i>all</i> flower. No sparing of colour
  anywhere&mdash;no outside coarsenesses&mdash;no interior secrecies; open
  as the sunshine that creates it; fine-finished on both sides, down to the
  extremest point of insertion on its narrow stalk; and robed in the purple
  of the Cæsars.</p>

  <p>Literally so. That poppy scarlet, so far as it could be painted by
  mortal hand, for mortal King, stays yet, against the sun, and wind, and
  rain, on the walls of the house of Augustus, a hundred yards from the
  spot where I gathered the weed of its desolation.</p>

  <p>10. A pure <i>cup</i>, you remember it is; that much at least <!--
  Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>[71]</span> you
  cannot but remember, of poppy-form among the cornfields; and it is best,
  in beginning, to think of every flower as essentially a cup. There are
  flat ones, but you will find that most of these are really groups of
  flowers, not single blossoms; and there are out-of-the-way and quaint
  ones, very difficult to define as of any shape; but even these have a cup
  to begin with, deep down in them. You had better take the idea of a cup
  or vase, as the first, simplest, and most general form of true
  flower.</p>

  <p>The botanists call it a corolla, which means a garland, or a kind of
  crown; and the word is a very good one, because it indicates that the
  flower-cup is made, as our clay cups are, on a potter's wheel; that it is
  essentially a <i>revolute</i> form&mdash;a whirl or (botanically) 'whorl'
  of leaves; in reality successive round the base of the urn they form.</p>

  <p>11. Perhaps, however, you think poppies in general are not much like
  cups. But the flower in my hand is a&mdash;poverty-<i>stricken</i> poppy,
  I was going to write,&mdash;poverty-<i>strengthened</i> poppy, I mean. On
  richer ground, it would have gushed into flaunting breadth of <span
  class="correction" title="'untenabie' in original">untenable</span>
  purple&mdash;flapped its inconsistent scarlet vaguely to the
  wind&mdash;dropped the pride of its petals over my hand in an hour after
  I gathered it. But this little rough-bred thing, a Campagna pony of a
  poppy, is as bright and strong to-day as yesterday. So that I can see
  exactly where the leaves join or lap over each other; and when I look
  down into the cup, find it to be composed of four leaves
  altogether,&mdash;two smaller, set within two larger. <!-- Page 72
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[72]</span></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/fig4.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig4.png"
      alt="Fig. 4. Petals of poppy." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 4.
  </div>
  <p>12. Thus far (and somewhat farther) I had written in Rome; but now,
  putting my work together in Oxford, a sudden doubt troubles me, whether
  all poppies have two petals smaller than the other two. Whereupon I take
  down an excellent little school-book on botany&mdash;the best I've yet
  found, thinking to be told quickly; and I find a great deal about opium;
  and, apropos of opium, that the juice of common celandine is of a bright
  orange colour; and I pause for a bewildered five minutes, wondering if a
  celandine is a poppy, and how many petals <i>it</i> has: going on
  again&mdash;because I must, without making up my mind, on either
  question&mdash;I am told to "observe the floral receptacle of the
  Californian genus Eschscholtzia." Now I can't observe anything of the
  sort, and I don't want to; and I wish California and all that's in it
  were at the deepest bottom of the Pacific. Next I am told to compare the
  poppy and waterlily; and I can't do that, neither&mdash;though I should
  like to; and there's the end of the article; and it never tells me
  whether one pair of petals is always smaller than the other, or not. Only
  I see it says the corolla has four petals. Perhaps a celandine may be a
  double poppy, and have eight, I know they're tiresome irregular things,
  and I mustn't be stopped by them;<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>&mdash;at <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>[73]</span> any rate, my Roman poppy
  knew what it was about, and had its two couples of leaves in clear
  subordination, of which at the time I went on to inquire farther, as
  follows.</p>

  <p>13. The next point is, what shape are the petals of? And that is
  easier asked than answered; for when you pull them off, you find they
  won't lie flat, by any means, but are each of them cups, or rather
  shells, themselves; and that it requires as much conchology as would
  describe a cockle, before you can properly give account of a single poppy
  leaf. Or of a single <i>any</i> leaf&mdash;for all leaves are either
  shells, or boats, (or solid, if not hollow, masses,) and cannot be
  represented in flat outline. But, laying these as flat as they will lie
  on a sheet of paper, you will find the piece they hide of the paper they
  lie on can be drawn; giving approximately the shape of the outer leaf as
  at A, that of the inner as at B, Fig. 4; which you will find very
  difficult lines to draw, for they are each composed of two curves,
  joined, as in Fig. 5; all above the line <i>a b</i> being the outer edge
  of the leaf, but joined so subtly to the side that the least break in
  drawing the line spoils the form.</p>

  <p>14. Now every flower petal consists essentially of these two parts,
  variously proportioned and outlined. It <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[74]</span> expands from C to <i>a
  b</i>; and closes in the external line, and for this reason.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Considering every flower under the type of a cup, the first part of
  the petal is that in which it expands from the bottom to the rim; the
  second part, that in which it terminates itself on reaching the rim. Thus
  let the three circles, A B C, Fig 6., represent the undivided cups of the
  three great geometrical orders of flowers&mdash;trefoil, quatrefoil and
  cinquefoil.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/fig6.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig6.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 6.
  </div>
  <p>Draw in the first an equilateral triangle, in the second a square, in
  the third a pentagon; draw the dark lines from centres to angles; (D E
  F): then (<i>a</i>) the third part of D; (<i>b</i>) the fourth part of E,
  (<i>c</i>) the fifth part of F, are the normal outline forms of the
  petals of the three <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>[75]</span> families; the relations between the
  developing angle and limiting curve being varied according to the depth
  of cup, and the degree of connection between the petals. Thus a rose
  folds them over one another, in the bud; a convolvulus twists
  them,&mdash;the one expanding into a flat cinquefoil of separate petals,
  and the other into a deep-welled cinquefoil of connected ones.</p>

  <p>I find an excellent illustration in Veronica Polita, one of the most
  perfectly graceful of field plants because of the light alternate flower
  stalks, each with its leaf at the base; the flower itself a quatrefoil,
  of which the largest and least petals are uppermost. Pull one off its
  calyx (draw, if you can, the outline of the striped blue upper petal with
  the jagged edge of pale gold below), and then examine the relative shapes
  of the lateral, and least upper <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>[76]</span> petal. Their under surface is very curious,
  as if covered with white paint; the blue stripes above, in the direction
  of their growth, deepening the more delicate colour with exquisite
  insistence.</p>

  <p>A lilac blossom will give you a pretty example of the expansion of the
  petals of a quatrefoil above the edge of the cup or tube; but I must get
  back to our poppy at present.</p>

  <p>15. What outline its petals really have, however, is little shown in
  their crumpled fluttering; but that very crumpling arises from a fine
  floral character which we do not enough value in them. We usually think
  of the poppy as a coarse flower; but it is the most transparent and
  delicate of all the blossoms of the field. The rest&mdash;nearly all of
  them&mdash;depend on the <i>texture</i> of their surfaces for colour. But
  the poppy is painted <i>glass</i>; it never glows so brightly as when the
  sun shines through it. Wherever it is seen&mdash;against the light or
  with the light&mdash;always, it is a flame, and warms the wind like a
  blown ruby.</p>

  <p>In these two qualities, the accurately balanced form, and the
  perfectly infused colour of the petals, you have, as I said, the central
  being of the flower. All the other parts of it are necessary, but we must
  follow them out in order.</p>

  <p>16. Looking down into the cup, you see the green boss divided by a
  black star,&mdash;of six rays only,&mdash;and surrounded by a few black
  spots. My rough-nurtured poppy contents itself with these for its centre;
  a rich one would have had the green boss divided by a dozen of rays, and
  surrounded by a dark crowd of crested threads. <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[77]</span></p>

  <p>This green boss is called by botanists the pistil, which word consists
  of the two first syllables of the Latin pistillum, otherwise more
  familiarly Englished into 'pestle.' The meaning of the botanical word is
  of course, also, that the central part of a flower-cup has to it
  something of the relations that a pestle has to a mortar! Practically,
  however, as this pestle has no pounding functions, I think the word is
  misleading as well as ungraceful; and that we may find a better one after
  looking a little closer into the matter. For this pestle is divided
  generally into three very distinct parts: there is a storehouse at the
  bottom of it for the seeds of the plant; above this, a shaft, often of
  considerable length in deep cups, rising to the level of their upper
  edge, or above it; and at the top of these shafts an expanded crest. This
  shaft the botanists call 'style,' from the Greek word for a pillar; and
  the crest of it&mdash;I do not know why&mdash;stigma, from the Greek word
  for 'spot.' The storehouse for the seeds they call the 'ovary,' from the
  Latin ovum, an egg. So you have two-thirds of a Latin word,
  (pistil)&mdash;awkwardly and disagreeably edged in between pestle and
  pistol&mdash;for the whole thing; you have an English-Latin word (ovary)
  for the bottom of it; an English-Greek word (style) for the middle; and a
  pure Greek word (stigma) for the top.</p>

  <p><a name="c4p17"></a> 17. This is a great mess of language, and all the
  worse that the words style and stigma have both of them quite different
  senses in ordinary and scholarly English from this forced botanical one.
  And I will venture therefore, <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>[78]</span> for my own pupils, to put the four names
  altogether into English. Instead of calling the whole thing a pistil, I
  shall simply call it the pillar. Instead of 'ovary,' I shall say
  'Treasury' (for a seed isn't an egg, but it <i>is</i> a treasure). The
  style I shall call the 'Shaft,' and the stigma the 'Volute.' So you will
  have your entire pillar divided into the treasury, at its base, the
  shaft, and the volute; and I think you will find these divisions easily
  remembered, and not unfitted to the sense of the words in their ordinary
  use.</p>

  <p>18. Round this central, but, in the poppy, very stumpy, pillar, you
  find a cluster of dark threads, with dusty pendants or cups at their
  ends. For these the botanists' name 'stamens,' may be conveniently
  retained, each consisting of a 'filament,' or thread, and an 'anther,' or
  blossoming part.</p>

  <p>And in this rich corolla, and pillar, or pillars, with their
  treasuries, and surrounding crowd of stamens, the essential flower
  consists. Fewer than these several parts, it cannot have, to be a flower
  at all; of these, the corolla leads, and is the object of final purpose.
  The stamens and the treasuries are only there in order to produce future
  corollas, though often themselves decorative in the highest degree.</p>

  <p>These, I repeat, are all the essential parts of a flower. But it would
  have been difficult, with any other than the poppy, to have shown you
  them alone; for nearly all other flowers keep with them, all their lives,
  their nurse <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>[79]</span> or tutor leaves,&mdash;the group which, in
  stronger and humbler temper, protected them in their first weakness, and
  formed them to the first laws of their being. But the poppy casts these
  tutorial leaves away. It is the finished picture of impatient and
  luxury-loving youth,&mdash;at first too severely restrained, then casting
  all restraint away,&mdash;yet retaining to the end of life unseemly and
  illiberal signs of its once compelled submission to laws which were only
  pain,&mdash;not instruction.</p>

  <p>19. Gather a green poppy bud, just when it shows the scarlet line at
  its side; break it open and unpack the poppy. The whole flower is there
  complete in size and colour,&mdash;its stamens full-grown, but all packed
  so closely that the fine silk of the petals is crushed into a million of
  shapeless wrinkles. When the flower opens, it seems a deliverance from
  torture: the two imprisoning green leaves are shaken to the ground; the
  aggrieved corolla smooths itself in the sun, and comforts itself as it
  can; but remains visibly crushed and hurt to the end of its days.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/fig7.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig7.png"
      alt="Fig. 7. Development of primrose flower." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 7.
  </div>
  <p>20. Not so flowers of gracious breeding. Look at these four stages in
  the young life of a primrose, Fig. 7. First confined, as strictly as the
  poppy within five pinching green leaves, whose points close over it, the
  little thing is content to remain a child, and finds its nursery large
  enough. The green leaves unclose their points,&mdash;the little yellow
  ones peep out, like ducklings. They find the light delicious, and open
  wide to it; and grow, and grow, <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>[80]</span> and throw themselves wider at last into
  their perfect rose. But they never leave their old nursery for all that;
  it and they live on together; and the nursery seems a part of the
  flower.</p>

  <p>21. Which is so, indeed, in all the loveliest flowers; and, in usual
  botanical parlance, a flower is said to consist of its calyx, (or
  <i>hiding</i> part&mdash;Calypso having rule over it,) and corolla, or
  garland part, Proserpina having rule over it. But it is better to think
  of them always as separate; for this calyx, very justly so named from its
  main function of concealing the flower, in its youth is usually green,
  not coloured, and shows its separate nature by pausing, or at least
  greatly lingering, in its growth, and modifying itself very slightly,
  while the corolla is forming <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>[81]</span> itself through active change. Look at the
  two, for instance, through the youth of a pease blossom, Fig. 8.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/fig8.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig8.png"
      alt="Fig. 8. Pease blossom." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 8.
  </div>
  <p>The entire cluster at first appears pendent in this manner, the stalk
  bending round on purpose to put it into that position. On which all the
  little buds, thinking themselves ill-treated, determine not to submit to
  anything of the sort, turn their points upward persistently, and
  determine that&mdash;at any cost of trouble&mdash;they will get nearer
  the sun. Then they begin to open, and let out their corollas. I give the
  process of one only (Fig. 9).<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> It chances to be engraved the reverse
  way from the bud; but that is of no consequence.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig9.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig9.png"
      alt="Fig. 9. Development of pease blossom." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 9.
  </div>
  <p>At first, you see the long lower point of the calyx thought that
  <i>it</i> was going to be the head of the family, and curls upwards
  eagerly. Then the little corolla steals out; and soon does away with that
  impression on the mind of the calyx. The corolla soars up with widening
  wings, the abashed calyx retreats beneath; and finally the great upper
  leaf of corolla&mdash;not pleased at having its back still <!-- Page 82
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[82]</span> turned to the
  light, and its face down&mdash;throws itself entirely back, to look at
  the sky, and nothing else;&mdash;and your blossom is complete.</p>

  <p>Keeping, therefore, the ideas of calyx and corolla entirely distinct,
  this one general point you may note of both: that, as a calyx is
  originally folded tight over the flower, and has to open deeply to let it
  out, it is nearly always composed of sharp pointed leaves like the
  segments of a balloon; while corollas, having to open out as wide as
  possible to show themselves, are typically like cups or plates, only cut
  into their edges here and there, for ornamentation's sake.</p>

  <p>22. And, finally, though the corolla is essentially the floral group
  of leaves, and usually receives the glory of colour for itself only, this
  glory and delight may be given to any other part of the group; and, as if
  to show us that there is no really dishonoured or degraded membership,
  the stalks and leaves in some plants, near the blossom, flush in sympathy
  with it, and become themselves a part of the <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[83]</span> effectively visible
  flower;&mdash;Eryngo&mdash;Jura hyacinth, (comosus,) and the edges of
  upper stems and leaves in many plants; while others, (Geranium lucidum,)
  are made to delight us with their leaves rather than their blossoms; only
  I suppose, in these, the scarlet leaf colour is a kind of early autumnal
  glow,&mdash;a beautiful hectic, and foretaste, in sacred youth, of sacred
  death.</p>

  <p>I observe, among the speculations of modern science, several, lately,
  not uningenious, and highly industrious, on the subject of the relation
  of colour in flowers, to insects&mdash;to selective development, etc.,
  etc. There <i>are</i> such relations, of course. So also, the blush of a
  girl, when she first perceives the faltering in her lover's step as he
  draws near, is related essentially to the existing state of her stomach;
  and to the state of it through all the years of her previous existence.
  Nevertheless, neither love, chastity, nor blushing, are merely exponents
  of digestion.</p>

  <p>All these materialisms, in their unclean stupidity, are essentially
  the work of human bats; men of semi-faculty or semi-education, who are
  more or less incapable of so much as seeing, much less thinking about,
  colour; among whom, for one-sided intensity, even Mr. Darwin must be
  often ranked, as in his vespertilian treatise on the ocelli of the Argus
  pheasant, which he imagines to be artistically gradated, and perfectly
  imitative of a ball and socket. If I had him here in Oxford for a week,
  and could force him to try to copy a feather by Bewick, or to draw for
  himself a boy's thumbed marble, his notions of feathers, and balls, <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[84]</span> would
  be changed for all the rest of his life. But his ignorance of good art is
  no excuse for the acutely illogical simplicity of the rest of his talk of
  colour in the "Descent of Man." Peacocks' tails, he thinks, are the
  result of the admiration of blue tails in the minds of well-bred
  peahens,&mdash;and similarly, mandrills' noses the result of the
  admiration of blue noses in well-bred baboons. But it never occurs to him
  to ask why the admiration of blue noses is healthy in baboons, so that it
  develops their race properly, while similar maidenly admiration either of
  blue noses or red noses in men would be improper, and develop the race
  improperly. The word itself 'proper' being one of which he has never
  asked, or guessed, the meaning. And when he imagined the gradation of the
  cloudings in feathers to represent successive generation, it never
  occurred to him to look at the much finer cloudy gradations in the clouds
  of dawn themselves; and explain the modes of sexual preference and
  selective development which had brought <i>them</i> to their scarlet
  glory, before the cock could crow thrice. Putting all these vespertilian
  speculations out of our way, the human facts concerning colour are
  briefly these. Wherever men are noble, they love bright colour; and
  wherever they can live healthily, bright colour is given them&mdash;in
  sky, sea, flowers, and living creatures.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, wherever men are ignoble and sensual, they endure
  without pain, and at last even come to like (especially if artists,)
  mud-colour and black, and to dislike rose-colour and white. And wherever
  it is unhealthy for <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>[85]</span> them to live, the poisonousness of the
  place is marked by some ghastly colour in air, earth, or flowers.</p>

  <p>There are, of course, exceptions to all such widely founded laws;
  there are poisonous berries of scarlet, and pestilent skies that are
  fair. But, if we once honestly compare a venomous wood-fungus, rotting
  into black dissolution of dripped slime at its edges, with a spring
  gentian; or a puff adder with a salmon trout, or a fog in Bermondsey with
  a clear sky at Berne, we shall get hold of the entire question on its
  right side; and be able afterwards to study at our leisure, or accept
  without doubt or trouble, facts of apparently contrary meaning. And the
  practical lesson which I wish to leave with the reader is, that lovely
  flowers, and green trees growing in the open air, are the proper guides
  of men to the places which their Maker intended them to inhabit; while
  the flowerless and treeless deserts&mdash;of reed, or sand, or
  rock,&mdash;are meant to be either heroically invaded and redeemed, or
  surrendered to the wild creatures which are appointed for them; happy and
  wonderful in their wild abodes.</p>

  <p>Nor is the world so small but that we may yet leave in it also
  unconquered spaces of beautiful solitude; where the chamois and red deer
  may wander fearless,&mdash;nor any fire of avarice scorch from the
  Highlands of Alp, or Grampian, the rapture of the heath, and the
  rose.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PAPAVER RHOEAS.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Brantwood</span>, <i>July 11th, 1875</i>.

  <p>1. Chancing to take up yesterday a favourite old book, Mavor's British
  Tourists, (London, 1798,) I found in its fourth volume a delightful diary
  of a journey made in 1782 through various parts of England, by Charles P.
  Moritz of Berlin.</p>

  <p>And in the fourteenth page of this diary I find the following passage,
  pleasantly complimentary to England:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The slices of bread and butter which they give you with your tea are
  as thin as poppy leaves. But there is another kind of bread and butter
  usually eaten with tea, which is toasted by the fire, and is incomparably
  good. This is called 'toast.'"</p>

  <p>I wonder how many people, nowadays, whose bread and butter was cut too
  thin for them, would think of comparing the slices to poppy leaves? But
  this was in the old days of travelling, when people did not whirl
  themselves past corn-fields, that they might have more time to walk on
  paving-stones; and understood that <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[87]</span> poppies did not mingle
  their scarlet among the gold, without some purpose of the poppy-Maker
  that they should be looked at.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, with respect to the good and polite German's
  poetically-contemplated, and finely æsthetic, tea, may it not be asked
  whether poppy leaves themselves, like the bread and butter, are not, if
  we may venture an opinion&mdash;<i>too</i> thin,&mdash;im-<i>properly</i>
  thin? In the last chapter, my reader was, I hope, a little anxious to
  know what I meant by saying that modern philosophers did not know the
  meaning of the word 'proper,' and may wish to know what I mean by it
  myself. And this I think it needful to explain before going farther.</p>

  <p><a name="c5p2"></a> 2. In our English prayer-book translation, the
  first verse of the ninety-third Psalm runs thus: "The Lord is King; and
  hath put on glorious apparel." And although, in the future republican
  world, there are to be no lords, no kings, and no glorious apparel, it
  will be found convenient, for botanical purposes, to remember what such
  things once were; for when I said of the poppy, in last chapter, that it
  was "robed in the purple of the Cæsars," the words gave, to any one who
  had a clear idea of a Cæsar, and of his dress, a better, and even
  <i>stricter</i>, account of the flower than if I had only said, with Mr.
  Sowerby, "petals bright scarlet;" which might just as well have been said
  of a pimpernel, or scarlet geranium;&mdash;but of neither of these latter
  should I have said "robed in purple of Cæsars." What I meant was, first,
  that the poppy leaf <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>[88]</span> looks dyed through and through, like glass,
  or Tyrian tissue; and not merely painted: secondly, that the splendour of
  it is proud,&mdash;almost insolently so. Augustus, in his glory, might
  have been clothed like one of these; and Saul; but not David, nor
  Solomon; still less the teacher of Solomon, when He puts on 'glorious
  apparel.'</p>

  <p>3. Let us look, however, at the two translations of the same
  verse.</p>

  <p>In the vulgate it is "Dominus regnavit; decorem indutus est;" He has
  put on 'becomingness,'&mdash;decent apparel, rather than glorious.</p>

  <p>In the Septuagint it is <span title="euprepeia" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&upsilon;&pi;&rho;&epsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&#x1F70;</span>&mdash;<i>well</i>-becomingness;
  an expression which, if the reader considers, must imply certainly the
  existence of an opposite idea of possible
  '<i>ill</i>-becomingness,'&mdash;of an apparel which should, in just as
  accurate a sense, belong appropriately to the creature invested with it,
  and yet not be glorious, but inglorious, and not well-becoming, but
  ill-becoming. The mandrill's blue nose, for instance, already referred
  to,&mdash;can we rightly speak of this as '<span title="euprepeia" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&upsilon;&pi;&rho;&epsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&#x1F70;</span>'?
  Or the stings, and minute, colourless blossoming of the nettle? May we
  call these a glorious apparel, as we may the glowing of an alpine
  rose?</p>

  <p>You will find on reflection, and find more convincingly the more
  accurately you reflect, that there is an absolute sense attached to such
  words as 'decent,' 'honourable,' 'glorious,' or '<span title="kalos" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,' contrary to another
  absolute sense in the words 'indecent,' 'shameful,' 'vile,' or '<span
  title="aischros" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F30;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.' <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>[89]</span></p>

  <p>And that there is every degree of these absolute qualities visible in
  living creatures; and that the divinity of the Mind of man is in its
  essential discernment of what is <span title="kalon" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span> from what is <span
  title="aischron" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F30;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>, and in his
  preference of the kind of creatures which are decent, to those which are
  indecent; and of the kinds of thoughts, in himself, which are noble, to
  those which are vile.</p>

  <p>4. When therefore I said that Mr. Darwin, and his school,<a
  name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> had no conception of the
  real meaning of the word 'proper,' I meant that they conceived the
  qualities of things only as their 'properties,' but not as their
  becomingnesses;' and seeing that dirt is proper to a swine, malice to a
  monkey, poison to a nettle, and folly to a fool, they called a nettle
  <i>but</i> a nettle, and the faults of fools but folly; and never saw the
  difference between ugliness and beauty absolute, decency and indecency
  absolute, glory or shame absolute, and folly or sense absolute.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 10.
  </div>
  <p>Whereas, the perception of beauty, and the power of defining physical
  character, are based on moral instinct, and on the power of defining
  animal or human character. Nor is it possible to say that one flower is
  more highly developed, or one animal of a higher order, than another,
  without the assumption of a divine law of perfection to which the one
  more conforms than the other.</p>

  <p>5. Thus, for instance. That it should ever have been an open question
  with me whether a poppy had always <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[90]</span> two of its petals less
  than the other two, depended wholly on the hurry and imperfection with
  which the poppy carries out its plan. It never would have occurred to me
  to <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[91]</span>
  doubt whether an iris had three of its leaves smaller than the other
  three, because an iris always completes itself to its own ideal.
  Nevertheless, on examining various poppies, as I have walked, this
  summer, up and down the hills between Sheffield and Wakefield, I find the
  subordination of the upper and lower petals entirely necessary and
  normal; and that the result of it is to give two distinct profiles to the
  poppy cup, the difference between which, however, we shall see better in
  the yellow Welsh poppy, at present called Meconopsis Cambrica; but which,
  in the Oxford schools, will be 'Papaver cruciforme'&mdash;'Crosslet
  Poppy,'&mdash;first, because all our botanical names must be in Latin if
  possible; Greek only allowed when we can do no better; secondly, because
  meconopsis is barbarous Greek; thirdly, and chiefly, because it is little
  matter whether this poppy be Welsh or English; but very needful that we
  should observe, wherever it grows, that the petals are arranged in what
  used to be, in my young days, called a diamond shape,<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> as at A, Fig. 10, the two narrow inner
  ones at right angles to, and projecting farther than, the two outside
  broad ones; and that the two broad ones, when the flower is seen in
  profile, as at B, show their margins folded back, as indicated by the
  thicker lines, and have a profile curve, which is only the softening, or
  melting away into each other, of two straight lines. Indeed, when the
  flower is younger, and quite strong, both its <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[92]</span> profiles, A and B, Fig.
  11, are nearly straight-sided; and always, be it young or old, one
  broader than the other, so as to give the flower, seen from above, the
  shape of a contracted cross, or crosslet.</p>

  <p>6. Now I find no notice of this flower in Gerarde; and in Sowerby, out
  of eighteen lines of closely printed descriptive text, no notice of its
  crosslet form, while the petals are only stated to be "roundish-concave,"
  terms equally applicable to at least one-half of all flower petals in the
  <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>[93]</span>
  world. The leaves are <i>said</i> to be very deeply pinnately partite;
  but <i>drawn</i>&mdash;as neither pinnate nor partite!</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 12.
  </div>
  <p>And this is your modern cheap science, in ten volumes. Now I haven't a
  quiet moment to spare for drawing this morning; but I merely give the
  main relations of the petals, A, and blot in the wrinkles of one of the
  lower ones, B, Fig. 12; and yet in this rude sketch you will feel, I
  believe, there is something specific which could not belong to any other
  flower. But all proper description is <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[94]</span> impossible without
  careful profiles of each petal laterally and across it. Which I may not
  find time to draw for any poppy whatever, because they none of them have
  well-becomingness enough to make it worth my while, being all more or
  less weedy, and ungracious, and mingled of good and evil. Whereupon rises
  before me, ghostly and untenable, the general question, 'What is a weed?'
  and, impatient for answer, the particular question, What is a poppy? I
  choose, for instance, to call this yellow flower a poppy, instead of a
  "likeness to poppy," which the botanists meant to call it, in their bad
  Greek. I choose also to call a poppy, what the botanists have called
  "glaucous thing," (glaucium). But where and when shall I stop calling
  things poppies? This is certainly a question to be settled at once, with
  others appertaining to it.</p>

  <p><a name="c5p7"></a> 7. In the first place, then, I mean to call every
  flower either one thing or another, and not an 'aceous' thing, only half
  something or half another. I mean to call this plant now in my hand,
  either a poppy or not a poppy; but not poppaceous. And this other, either
  a thistle or not a thistle; but not thistlaceous. And this other, either
  a nettle or not a nettle; but not nettlaceous. I know it will be very
  difficult to carry out this principle when tribes of plants are much
  extended and varied in type: I shall persist in it, however, as far as
  possible; and when plants change so much that one cannot with any
  conscience call them by their family name any more, I shall put them
  aside somewhere among families of poor relations, not <!-- Page 95
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[95]</span> to be minded
  for the present, until we are well acquainted with the better bred
  circles; I don't know, for instance, whether I shall call the Burnet
  'Grass-rose,' or put it out of court for having no petals; but it
  certainly shall not be called rosaceous; and my first point will be to
  make sure of my pupils having a clear idea of the central and
  unquestionable forms of thistle, grass, or rose, and assigning to them
  pure Latin, and pretty English, names,&mdash;classical, if possible; and
  at least intelligible and decorous.</p>

  <p>8. I return to our present special question, then, What is a poppy?
  and return also to a book I gave away long ago, and have just begged back
  again, Dr. Lindley's 'Ladies' Botany.' For without at all looking upon
  ladies as inferior beings, I dimly hope that what Dr. Lindley considers
  likely to be intelligible to <i>them</i>, may be also clear to their very
  humble servant.</p>

  <p>The poppies, I find, (page 19, vol. i.) differ from crowfeet in being
  of a stupifying instead of a burning nature, and in generally having two
  sepals and twice two petals; "but as some poppies have three sepals, and
  twice three petals, the number of these parts is not sufficiently
  constant to form an essential mark." Yes, I know that, for I found a
  superb six-petaled poppy, spotted like a cistus, the other day in a
  friend's garden. But then, what makes it a poppy still? That it is of a
  stupifying nature, and itself so stupid that it does not know how many
  petals it should have, is surely not enough distinction?</p>

  <p>9. Returning to Lindley, and working the matter <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[96]</span> farther out with his
  help, I think this definition might stand. "A poppy is a flower which has
  either four or six petals, and two or more treasuries, united into one;
  containing a milky, stupifying fluid in its stalks and leaves, and always
  throwing away its calyx when it blossoms."</p>

  <p>And indeed, every flower which unites all these characters, we shall,
  in the Oxford schools, call 'poppy,' and 'Papaver;' but when I get fairly
  into work, I hope to fix my definitions into more strict terms. For I
  wish all my pupils to form the habit of asking, of every plant, these
  following four questions, in order, corresponding to the subject of these
  opening chapters, namely, "What root has it? what leaf? what flower? and
  what stem?" And, in this definition of poppies, nothing whatever is said
  about the root; and not only I don't know myself what a poppy root is
  like, but in all Sowerby's poppy section, I find no word whatever about
  that matter.</p>

  <p>10. Leaving, however, for the present, the root unthought of, and
  contenting myself with Dr. Lindley's characteristics, I shall place, at
  the head of the whole group, our common European wild poppy, Papaver
  Rhoeas, and, with this, arrange the nine following other flowers
  thus,&mdash;opposite.</p>

  <p>I must be content at present with determining the Latin names for the
  Oxford schools; the English ones I shall give as they chance to occur to
  me, in Gerarde and the classical poets who wrote before the English
  revolution. When no satisfactory name is to be found, I must try to
  invent one; as, for instance, just now, I don't like Gerarde's
  'Corn-rose' for Papaver Rhoeas, and must coin another; but this can't be
  done by thinking; it will come into my head some day, by chance. I might
  try at it straightforwardly for a week together, and not do it.</p>

  <p>The Latin names must be fixed at once, somehow; and therefore I do the
  best I can, keeping as much respect for the old nomenclature as possible,
  though this involves the illogical practice of giving the epithet
  sometimes from the flower, (violaceum, cruciforme), and sometimes from
  the seed vessel, (elatum, echinosum, corniculatum). Guarding this
  distinction, however, we may perhaps be content to call the six last of
  the group, in English, Urchin Poppy, Violet Poppy, Crosslet Poppy, Horned
  Poppy, Beach Poppy, and Welcome Poppy. I don't think the last flower
  pretty enough to be connected more directly with the swallow, in its
  English name.</p>

  <p>11. I shall be well content if my pupils know these ten poppies
  rightly; all of them at present wild in our own country, and, I believe,
  also European in range: the head and type of all being the common wild
  poppy of our cornfields for which the name 'Papaver Rhoeas,' given it by
  Dioscorides, Gerarde, and Linnæus, is entirely authoritative, and we will
  therefore at once examine the meaning, and reason, of that name.</p>

  <p>12. Dioscorides says the name belongs to it "<span title="dia to tacheôs to anthos apoballein" class="grk"

  'swiftly ruinous' poppy, but notice, in connection with this idea, how it
  droops its head <i>before</i> blooming; an action which, I doubt not,
  mingled in Homer's thought with the image of its depression when filled
  by rain, in the passage of the Iliad, which, as I have relieved your
  memory of three unnecessary names of poppy families, you have memory to
  spare for learning.</p>

  <p>"And as a poppy lets its head fall aside, which in a garden is loaded
  with its fruit, and with the soft rains of spring, so the youth drooped
  his head on one side; burdened with the helmet."</p>

  <p>And now you shall compare the translations of this passage, with its
  context, by Chapman and Pope&mdash;(or the school of Pope), the one being
  by a man of pure English temper, and able therefore to understand pure
  Greek temper; the other infected with all the faults of the falsely
  classical school of the Renaissance.</p>

  <p>First I take Chapman:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"His shaft smit fair Gorgythion of Priam's princely race</p>
      <p>Who in Æpina was brought forth, a famous town in Thrace,</p>
<!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[100]</span>
      <p>By Castianeira, that for form was like celestial breed.</p>
      <p>And as a crimson poppy-flower, surcharged with his seed,</p>
      <p>And vernal humours falling thick, declines his heavy brow,</p>
      <p>So, a-oneside, his helmet's weight his fainting head did bow."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Next, Pope:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He missed the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,</p>
      <p>And drenched in royal blood the thirsty dart:</p>
      <p>(Fair Castianeira, nymph of form divine,</p>
      <p>This offspring added to King Priam's line).</p>
      <p>As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,</p>
      <p>Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain,</p>
      <p>So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depressed</p>
      <p>Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>13. I give you the two passages in full, trusting that you may so feel
  the becomingness of the one, and the gracelessness of the other. But note
  farther, in the Homeric passage, one subtlety which cannot enough be
  marked even in Chapman's English, that his second word, <span
  title="êmuse" class="grk">&#x1F24;&mu;&upsilon;&sigma;&epsilon;</span>,
  is employed by him both of the stooping of ears of corn, under wind, and
  of Troy stooping to its ruin;<a name="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> and otherwise, in good Greek writers,
  the word is marked as having such specific sense of men's drooping under
  weight; or towards death, under the burden of fortune which they have no
  more strength to sustain;<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> compare the passage <!-- Page 101
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>[101]</span> I quoted from
  Plato, ('Crown of Wild Olive,' p. 95): "And bore lightly the burden of
  gold and of possessions." <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[102]</span> And thus you will begin to understand how
  the poppy became in the heathen mind the type at once of power, or pride,
  and of its loss; and therefore, both why Virgil represents the white
  nymph Nais, "pallentes violas, et summa papavera
  carpens,"&mdash;gathering the pale flags, and the highest
  poppies,&mdash;and the reason for the choice of this rather than any
  other flower, in the story of Tarquin's message to his son.</p>

  <p>14. But you are next to remember the word Rhoeas in another sense.
  Whether originally intended or afterwards caught at, the resemblance of
  the word to 'Rhoea,' a pomegranate, mentally connects itself with the
  resemblance of the poppy head to the pomegranate fruit.</p>

  <p>And if I allow this flower to be the first we take up for careful
  study in Proserpina, on account of its simplicity of form and splendour
  of colour, I wish you also to remember, in connection with it, the cause
  of Proserpine's eternal captivity&mdash;her having tasted a pomegranate
  seed,&mdash;the pomegranate being in Greek mythology what the apple is in
  the Mosaic legend; and, in the whole <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[103]</span> worship of Demeter,
  associated with the poppy by a multitude of ideas which are not
  definitely expressed, but can only be gathered out of Greek art and
  literature, as we learn their symbolism. The chief character on which
  these thoughts are founded is the fulness of seed in the poppy and
  pomegranate, as an image of life: then the forms of both became adopted
  for beads or bosses in ornamental art; the pomegranate remains more
  distinctly a Jewish and Christian type, from its use in the border of
  Aaron's robe, down to the fruit in the hand of Angelico's and
  Botticelli's Infant Christs; while the poppy is gradually confused by the
  Byzantine Greeks with grapes; and both of these with palm fruit. The
  palm, in the shorthand of their art, gradually becomes a symmetrical
  branched ornament with two pendent bosses; this is again confused with
  the Greek iris, (Homer's blue iris, and Pindar's water-flag,)&mdash;and
  the Florentines, in adopting Byzantine ornament, read it into their own
  Fleur-de-lys; but insert two poppyheads on each side of the entire foil,
  in their finest heraldry.</p>

  <p>15. Meantime the definitely intended poppy, in late Christian Greek
  art of the twelfth century, modifies the form of the Acanthus leaf with
  its own, until the northern twelfth century workman takes the
  thistle-head for the poppy, and the thistle-leaf for acanthus. The true
  poppy-head remains in the south, but gets more and more confused with
  grapes, till the Renaissance carvers are content with any kind of boss
  full of seed, but insist on such boss <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>[104]</span> or bursting globe as
  some essential part of their ornament;&mdash;the bean-pod for the same
  reason (not without Pythagorean notions, and some of republican election)
  is used by Brunelleschi for main decoration of the lantern of Florence
  duomo; and, finally, the ornamentation gets so shapeless, that M.
  Violet-le-Duc, in his 'Dictionary of Ornament,' loses trace of its origin
  altogether, and fancies the later forms were derived from the spadix of
  the arum.</p>

  <p>16. I have no time to enter into farther details; but through all this
  vast range of art, note this singular fact, that the wheat-ear, the vine,
  the fleur-de-lys, the poppy, and the jagged leaf of the acanthus-weed, or
  thistle, occupy the entire thoughts of the decorative workmen trained in
  classic schools, to the exclusion of the rose, true lily, and the other
  flowers of luxury. And that the deeply underlying reason of this is in
  the relation of weeds to corn, or of the adverse powers of nature to the
  beneficent ones, expressed for us readers of the Jewish scriptures,
  centrally in the verse, "thorns also, and thistles, shall it bring forth
  to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field" (<span title="chortos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&omicron;&rho;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, grass or corn), and
  exquisitely symbolized throughout the fields of Europe by the presence of
  the purple 'corn-flag,' or gladiolus, and 'corn-rose' (Gerarde's name for
  Papaver Rhoeas), in the midst of carelessly tended corn; and in the
  traditions of the art of Europe by the springing of the acanthus round
  the basket of the canephora, strictly the basket <i>for bread</i>, the
  idea of bread <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>[105]</span> including all sacred things carried at
  the feasts of Demeter, Bacchus, and the Queen of the Air. And this
  springing of the thorny weeds round the basket of reed, distinctly taken
  up by the Byzantine Italians in the basketwork capital of the twelfth
  century, (which I have already illustrated at length in the 'Stones of
  Venice,') becomes the germ of all capitals whatsoever, in the great
  schools of Gothic, to the end of Gothic time, and also of all the
  capitals of the pure and noble Renaissance architecture of Angelico and
  Perugino, and all that was learned from them in the north, while the
  introduction of the rose, as a primal element of decoration, only takes
  place when the luxury of English decorated Gothic, the result of that
  licentious spirit in the lords which brought on the Wars of the Roses,
  indicates the approach of destruction to the feudal, artistic, and moral
  power of the northern nations.</p>

  <p>For which reason, and many others, I must yet delay the following out
  of our main subject, till I have answered the other question, which
  brought me to pause in the middle of this chapter, namely, 'What is a

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE PARABLE OF JOASH.</p>

  <p>1. Some ten or twelve years ago, I bought&mdash;three times twelve are
  thirty-six&mdash;of a delightful little book by Mrs. Gatty, called 'Aunt
  Judy's Tales'&mdash;whereof to make presents to my little lady friends. I
  had, at that happy time, perhaps from four-and-twenty to
  six-and-thirty&mdash;I forget exactly how many&mdash;very particular
  little lady friends; and greatly wished Aunt Judy to be the
  thirty-seventh,&mdash;the kindest, wittiest, prettiest girl one had ever
  read of, at least in so entirely proper and orthodox literature.</p>

  <p>2. Not but that it is a suspicious sign of infirmity of faith in our
  modern moralists to make their exemplary young people always pretty; and
  dress them always in the height of the fashion. One may read Miss
  Edgeworth's 'Harry and Lucy,' 'Frank and Mary,' 'Fashionable Tales,' or
  'Parents' Assistant,' through, from end to end, with extremest care; and
  never find out whether Lucy was tall or short, nor whether Mary was dark
  or fair, nor how Miss Annaly was dressed, nor&mdash;which was my own
  chief point of interest&mdash;what was the colour of <!-- Page 107
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span> Rosamond's
  eyes. Whereas Aunt Judy, in charming position after position, is shown to
  have expressed all her pure evangelical principles with the prettiest of
  lips; and to have had her gown, though puritanically plain, made by one
  of the best modistes in London.</p>

  <p>3. Nevertheless, the book is wholesome and useful; and the nicest
  story in it, as far as I recollect, is an inquiry into the subject which
  is our present business, 'What is a weed?'&mdash;in which, by many
  pleasant devices, Aunt Judy leads her little brothers and sisters to
  discern that a weed is 'a plant in the wrong place.'</p>

  <p>'Vegetable' in the wrong place, by the way, I think Aunt Judy says,
  being a precisely scientific little aunt. But I can't keep it out of my
  own less scientific head that 'vegetable' means only something going to
  be boiled. I like 'plant' better for general sense, besides that it's
  shorter.</p>

  <p>Whatever we call them, Aunt Judy is perfectly right about them as far
  as she has gone; but, as happens often even to the best of evangelical
  instructresses, she has stopped just short of the gist of the whole
  matter. It is entirely true that a weed is a plant that has got into a
  wrong place; but it never seems to have occurred to Aunt Judy that some
  plants never <i>do</i>!</p>

  <p>Who ever saw a wood anemone or a heath blossom in the wrong place? Who
  ever saw nettle or hemlock in a right one? And yet, the difference
  between flower and weed, (I use, for convenience sake, these words in
  their <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[108]</span> familiar opposition,) certainly does not
  consist merely in the flowers being innocent, and the weed stinging and
  venomous. We do not call the nightshade a weed in our hedges, nor the
  scarlet agaric in our woods. But we do the corncockle in our fields.</p>

  <p>4. Had the thoughtful little tutoress gone but one thought farther,
  and instead of "a vegetable in a wrong place," (which it may happen to
  the innocentest vegetable sometimes to be, without turning into a weed,
  therefore,) said, "A vegetable which has an innate disposition to
  <i>get</i> into the wrong place," she would have greatly furthered the
  matter for us; but then she perhaps would have felt herself to be
  uncharitably dividing with vegetables her own little evangelical property
  of original sin.</p>

  <p>5. This, you will find, nevertheless, to be the very essence of weed
  character&mdash;in plants, as in men. If you glance through your
  botanical books, you will see often added certain names&mdash;'a
  troublesome weed.' It is not its being venomous, or ugly, but its being
  impertinent&mdash;thrusting itself where it has no business, and hinders
  other people's business&mdash;that makes a weed of it. The most accursed
  of all vegetables, the one that has destroyed for the present even the
  possibility of European civilization, is only called a weed in the slang
  of its votaries;<a name="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> but in
  the finest and truest English we call so the plant which <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span> has come to
  us by chance from the same country, the type of mere senseless prolific
  activity, the American water-plant, choking our streams till the very
  fish that leap out of them cannot fall back, but die on the clogged
  surface; and indeed, for this unrestrainable, unconquerable insolence of
  uselessness, what name can be enough dishonourable?</p>

  <p>6. I pass to vegetation of nobler rank.</p>

  <p>You remember, I was obliged in the last chapter to leave my poppy, for
  the present, without an English specific name, because I don't like
  Gerarde's 'Corn-rose,' and can't yet think of another. Nevertheless, I
  would have used Gerarde's name, if the corn-rose were as much a rose as
  the corn-flag is a flag. But it isn't. The rose and lily have quite
  different relations to the corn. The lily is grass in loveliness, as the
  corn is grass in use; and both grow together in peace&mdash;gladiolus in
  the wheat, and narcissus in the pasture. But the rose is of another and
  higher order than the corn, and you never saw a cornfield overrun with
  sweetbriar or apple-blossom.</p>

  <p>They have no mind, they, to get into the wrong place.</p>

  <p>What is it, then, this temper in some plants&mdash;malicious as it
  seems&mdash;intrusive, at all events, or erring,&mdash;which brings them
  out of their places&mdash;thrusts them where they thwart us and
  offend?</p>

  <p>7. Primarily, it is mere hardihood and coarseness of make. A plant
  that can live anywhere, will often live where it is not wanted. But the
  delicate and tender ones <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>[110]</span> keep at home. You have no trouble in
  'keeping down' the spring gentian. It rejoices in its own Alpine home,
  and makes the earth as like heaven as it can, but yields as softly as the
  air, if you want it to give place. Here in England, it will only grow on
  the loneliest moors, above the high force of Tees; its Latin name, for
  <i>us</i> (I may as well tell you at once) is to be 'Lucia verna;' and
  its English one, Lucy of Teesdale.</p>

  <p>8. But a plant may be hardy, and coarse of make, and able to live
  anywhere, and yet be no weed. The coltsfoot, so far as I know, is the
  first of large-leaved plants to grow afresh on ground that has been
  disturbed: fall of Alpine débris, ruin of railroad embankment, waste of
  drifted slime by flood, it seeks to heal and redeem; but it does not
  offend us in our gardens, nor impoverish us in our fields.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, mere coarseness of structure, indiscriminate hardihood,
  is at least a point of some unworthiness in a plant. That it should have
  no choice of home, no love of native land, is ungentle; much more if such
  discrimination as it has, be immodest, and incline it, seemingly, to open
  and much-traversed places, where it may be continually seen of strangers.
  The tormentilla gleams in showers along the mountain turf; her delicate
  crosslets are separate, though constellate, as the rubied daisy. But the
  king-cup&mdash;(blessing be upon it always no less)&mdash;crowds itself
  sometimes into too burnished flame of inevitable gold. I don't know if
  there was anything in the <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>[111]</span> darkness of this last spring to make it
  brighter in resistance; but I never saw any spaces of full warm yellow,
  in natural colour, so intense as the meadows between Reading and the
  Thames; nor did I know perfectly what purple and gold meant, till I saw a
  field of park land embroidered a foot deep with king-cup and
  clover&mdash;while I was correcting my last notes on the spring colours
  of the Royal Academy&mdash;at Aylesbury.</p>

  <p>9. And there are two other questions of extreme subtlety connected
  with this main one. What shall we say of the plants whose entire destiny
  is parasitic&mdash;which are not only sometimes, and
  <i>im</i>pertinently, but always, and pertinently, out of place; not only
  out of the right place, but out of any place of their own? When is
  mistletoe, for instance, in the right place, young ladies, think you? On
  an apple tree, or on a ceiling? When is ivy in the right
  place?&mdash;when wallflower? The ivy has been torn down from the towers
  of Kenilworth; the weeds from the arches of the Coliseum, and from the
  steps of the Araceli, irreverently, vilely, and in vain; but how are we
  to separate the creatures whose office it is to abate the grief of ruin
  by their gentleness,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"wafting wallflower scents</p>
      <p>From out the crumbling ruins of fallen pride,</p>
      <p>And chambers of transgression, now forlorn,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>from those which truly resist the toil of men, and conspire against
  their fame; which are cunning to consume, and <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[112]</span> prolific to encumber;
  and of whose perverse and unwelcome sowing we know, and can say
  assuredly, "An enemy hath done this."</p>

  <p>10. Again. The character of strength which gives prevalence over
  others to any common plant, is more or less consistently dependent on
  woody fibre in the leaves; giving them strong ribs and great expanding
  extent; or spinous edges, and wrinkled or gathered extent.</p>

  <p>Get clearly into your mind the nature of those two conditions. When a
  leaf is to be spread wide, like the Burdock, it is supported by a
  framework of extending ribs like a Gothic roof. The supporting function
  of these is geometrical; every one is constructed like the girders of a
  bridge, or beams of a floor, with all manner of science in the
  distribution of their substance in the section, for narrow and deep
  strength; and the shafts are mostly hollow. But when the extending space
  of a leaf is to be enriched with fulness of folds, and become beautiful
  in wrinkles, this may be done either by pure undulation as of a liquid
  current along the leaf edge, or by sharp 'drawing'&mdash;or 'gathering' I
  believe ladies would call it&mdash;and stitching of the edges together.
  And this stitching together, if to be done very strongly, is done round a
  bit of stick, as a sail is reefed round a mast; and this bit of stick
  needs to be compactly, not geometrically strong; its function is
  essentially that of starch,&mdash;not to hold the leaf up off the ground
  against gravity; but to stick the edges out, stiffly, in a crimped frill.
  And in beautiful work of <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>[113]</span> this kind, which we are meant to study,
  the stays of the leaf&mdash;or stay-bones&mdash;are finished off very
  sharply and exquisitely at the points; and indeed so much so, that they
  prick our fingers when we touch them; for they are not at all meant to be
  touched, but admired.</p>

  <p>11. To be admired,&mdash;with qualification, indeed, always, but with
  extreme respect for their endurance and orderliness. Among flowers that
  pass away, and leaves that shake as with ague, or shrink like bad
  cloth,&mdash;these, in their sturdy growth and enduring life, we are
  bound to honour; and, under the green holly, remember how much softer
  friendship was failing, and how much of other loving, folly. And
  yet&mdash;you are not to confuse the thistle with the cedar that is in
  Lebanon; nor to forget&mdash;if the spinous nature of it become too cruel
  to provoke and offend&mdash;the parable of Joash to Amaziah, and its
  fulfilment: "There passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode
  down the thistle."</p>

  <p>12. Then, lastly, if this rudeness and insensitiveness of nature be
  gifted with no redeeming beauty; if the boss of the thistle lose its
  purple, and the star of the Lion's tooth, its light; and, much more, if
  service be perverted as beauty is lost, and the honied tube, and
  medicinal leaf, change into mere swollen emptiness, and salt brown
  membrane, swayed in nerveless languor by the idle sea,&mdash;at last the
  separation between the two natures is as great as between the fruitful
  earth and fruitless ocean; and between the living hands that tend the
  Garden of Herbs where <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span> Love is, and those unclasped, that toss
  with tangle and with shells.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>13. I had a long bit in my head, that I wanted to write, about St.
  George of the Seaweed, but I've no time to do it; and those few words of
  Tennyson's are enough, if one thinks of them: only I see, in correcting
  press, that I've partly misapplied the idea of 'gathering' in the leaf
  edge. It would be more accurate to say it was gathered at the central
  rib; but there is nothing in needlework that will represent the actual
  excess by lateral growth at the edge, giving three or four inches of edge
  for one of centre. But the stiffening of the fold by the thorn which
  holds it out is very like the action of a ship's spars on its sails; and
  absolutely in many cases like that of the spines in a fish's fin, passing
  into the various conditions of serpentine and dracontic crest, connected
  with all the terrors and adversities of nature; not to be dealt with in a
  chapter on weeds.</p>

  <p>14. Here is a sketch of a crested leaf of less adverse temper, which
  may as well be given, together with Plate III., in this number, these two
  engravings being meant for examples of two different methods of drawing,
  both useful according to character of subject. Plate III. is sketched
  first with a finely-pointed pen, and common ink, on white paper; then
  washed rapidly with colour, and retouched with the pen to give sharpness
  and completion. <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[115]</span> This method is used because the thistle
  leaves are full of complex and sharp sinuosities, and set with intensely
  sharp spines passing into hairs, which require many kinds of execution
  with the fine point to imitate at all. In the drawing there was more look
  of the bloom or woolliness on the stems, but it was useless to try for
  this in the mezzotint, and I desired Mr. Allen to leave his work at the
  stage where it expressed as much form as I wanted. The leaves are of the
  common marsh thistle, of which more anon; and the two long lateral ones
  are only two different views of the same leaf, while the central figure
  is a young leaf just opening. It beat me, in its delicate bossing, and I
  had to leave it, discontentedly enough.</p>

  <p>Plate IV. is much better work, being of an easier subject, adequately
  enough rendered by perfectly simple means. Here I had only a succulent
  and membranous surface to represent, with definite outlines, and merely
  undulating folds; and this is sufficiently done by a careful and firm pen
  outline on grey paper, with a slight wash of colour afterwards,
  reinforced in the darks; then marking the lights with white. This method
  is classic and authoritative, being used by many of the greatest masters,
  (by Holbein continually;) and it is much the best which the general
  student can adopt for expression of the action and muscular power of
  plants.</p>

  <p>The goodness or badness of such work depends absolutely on the truth
  of the single line. You will find a thousand botanical drawings which
  will give you a <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[116]</span> delicate and deceptive resemblance of the
  leaf, for one that will give you the right convexity in its backbone, the
  right perspective of its peaks when they foreshorten, or the right
  relation of depth in the shading of its dimples. On which, in leaves as
  in faces, no little expression of temper depends.</p>

  <p>Meantime we have yet to consider somewhat more touching that temper
  itself, in next chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE PARABLE OF JOTHAM.</p>

  <p>1. I do not know if my readers were checked, as I wished them to be,
  at least for a moment, in the close of the last chapter, by my talking of
  thistles and dandelions changing into seaweed, by gradation of which,
  doubtless, Mr. Darwin can furnish us with specious and sufficient
  instances. But the two groups will not be contemplated in our Oxford
  system as in any parental relations whatsoever.</p>

  <p>We shall, however, find some very notable relations existing between
  the two groups of the wild flowers of dry land, which represent, in the
  widest extent, and the distinctest opposition, the two characters of
  material serviceableness and unserviceableness; the groups which in our
  English classification will be easily remembered as those of the Thyme,
  and the Daisy.</p>

  <p>The one, scented as with incense&mdash;medicinal&mdash;and in all
  gentle and humble ways, useful. The other, scentless&mdash;helpless for
  ministry to the body; infinitely dear as the bringer of light, ruby,
  white and gold; the three colours of the Day, with no hue of shade in it.
  Therefore I <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>[118]</span> take it on the coins of St. George for
  the symbol of the splendour or light of heaven, which is dearest where
  humblest.</p>

  <p>2. Now these great two orders&mdash;of which the types are the thyme
  and the daisy&mdash;you are to remember generally as the 'Herbs' and the
  'Sunflowers.' You are not to call them Lipped flowers, nor Composed
  flowers; because the first is a vulgar term; for when you once come to be
  able to draw a lip, or, in noble duty, to kiss one, you will know that no
  other flower in earth is like that: and the second is an indefinite term;
  for a foxglove is as much a 'composed' flower as a daisy; but it is
  composed in the shape of a spire, instead of the shape of the sun. And
  again a thistle, which common botany calls a composed flower, as well as
  a daisy, is composed in quite another shape, being on the whole, bossy
  instead of flat; and of another temper, or composition of mind, also,
  being connected in that respect with butterburs, and a vast company of
  rough, knotty, half-black or brown, and generally
  unluminous&mdash;flowers I can scarcely call them&mdash;and weeds I will
  not,&mdash;creatures, at all events, in nowise to be gathered under the
  general name 'Composed,' with the stars that crown Chaucer's Alcestis,
  when she returns to the day from the dead.</p>

  <p>But the wilder and stronger blossoms of the Hawk's-eye&mdash;again you
  see I refuse for them the word weed;&mdash;and the waste-loving Chicory,
  which the Venetians call "Sponsa solis," are all to be held in one class
  with the <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>[119]</span> Sunflowers; but dedicate,&mdash;the daisy
  to Alcestis alone; others to Clytia, or the Physician Apollo himself: but
  I can't follow their mythology yet awhile.</p>

  <p>3. Now in these two families you have typically Use opposed to Beauty
  in <i>wildness</i>; it is their wildness which is their
  virtue;&mdash;that the thyme is sweet where it is unthought of, and the
  daisies red, where the foot despises them: while, in other orders,
  wildness is their crime,&mdash;"Wherefore, when I looked that it should
  bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?" But in all of them you
  must distinguish between the pure wildness of flowers and their distress.
  It may not be our duty to tame them; but it must be, to relieve.</p>

  <p>4. It chanced, as I was arranging the course of these two chapters,
  that I had examples given me of distressed and happy wildness, in
  immediate contrast. The first, I grieve to say, was in a bit of my own
  brushwood, left uncared-for evidently many a year before it became mine.
  I had to cut my way into it through a mass of thorny ruin; black,
  birds-nest like, entanglement of brittle spray round twisted stems of
  ill-grown birches strangling each other, and changing half into roots
  among the rock clefts; knotted stumps of never-blossoming blackthorn, and
  choked stragglings of holly, all laced and twisted and tethered round
  with an untouchable, almost unhewable, thatch, a foot thick, of dead
  bramble and rose, laid over rotten ground through which the water soaked
  ceaselessly, undermining it into merely unctuous <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span> clods and clots,
  knitted together by mossy sponge. It was all Nature's free doing! she had
  had her way with it to the uttermost; and clearly needed human help and
  interference in her business; and yet there was not one plant in the
  whole ruinous and deathful riot of the place, whose nature was not in
  itself wholesome and lovely; but all lost for want of discipline.</p>

  <p>5. The other piece of wild growth was among the fallen blocks of
  limestone under Malham Cove. Sheltered by the cliff above from stress of
  wind, the ash and hazel wood spring there in a fair and perfect freedom,
  without a diseased bough, or an unwholesome shade. I do not know why mine
  is all encumbered with overgrowth, and this so lovely that scarce a
  branch could be gathered but with injury;&mdash;while underneath, the
  oxalis, and the two smallest geraniums (Lucidum and Herb-Robert) and the
  mossy saxifrage, and the cross-leaved bed-straw, and the white pansy,
  wrought themselves into wreaths among the fallen crags, in which every
  leaf rejoiced, and was at rest.</p>

  <p>6. Now between these two states of equally natural growth, the point
  of difference that forced itself on me (and practically enough, in the
  work I had in my own wood), was not so much the withering and waste of
  the one, and the life of the other, as the thorniness and cruelty of the
  one, and the softness of the other. In Malham Cove, the stones of the
  brook were softer with moss than any silken pillow&mdash;the crowded
  oxalis leaves yielded to the pressure of the hand, and were not
  felt&mdash;the cloven <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>[121]</span> leaves of the Herb-Robert and orbed
  clusters of its companion overflowed every rent in the rude crags with
  living balm; there was scarcely a place left by the tenderness of the
  happy things, where one might not lay down one's forehead on their warm
  softness, and sleep. But in the waste and distressed ground, the distress
  had changed itself to cruelty. The leaves had all perished, and the
  bending saplings, and the wood of trust;&mdash;but the thorns were there,
  immortal, and the gnarled and sapless roots, and the dusty treacheries of
  decay.</p>

  <p>7. Of which things you will find it good to consider also otherwise
  than botanically. For all these lower organisms suffer and perish, or are
  gladdened and flourish, under conditions which are in utter precision
  symbolical, and in utter fidelity representative, of the conditions which
  induce adversity and prosperity in the kingdoms of men: and the Eternal
  Demeter,&mdash;Mother, and Judge,&mdash;brings forth, as the herb
  yielding seed, so also the thorn and the thistle, not to herself, but
  <i>to thee</i>.</p>

  <p>8. You have read the words of the great Law often enough;&mdash;have
  you ever thought enough of them to know the difference between these two
  appointed means of Distress? The first, the Thorn, is the type of
  distress <i>caused by crime</i>, changing the soft and breathing leaf
  into inflexible and wounding stubbornness. The second is the distress
  appointed to be the means and herald of good,&mdash;Thou shalt see the
  stubborn thistle bursting, into glossy purple, which outredden, all
  voluptuous garden roses. <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>[122]</span></p>

  <p>9. It is strange that, after much hunting, I cannot find authentic
  note of the day when Scotland took the thistle for her emblem; and I have
  no space (in this chapter at least) for tradition; but, with whatever
  lightness of construing we may receive the symbol, it is actually the
  truest that could have been found, for some conditions of the Scottish
  mind. There is no flower which the Proserpina of our Northern Sicily
  cherishes more dearly: and scarcely any of us recognize enough the
  beautiful power of its close-set stars, and rooted radiance of ground
  leaves; yet the stubbornness and ungraceful rectitude of its stem, and
  the besetting of its wholesome substance with that fringe of offence, and
  the forwardness of it, and dominance,&mdash;I fear to lacess some of my
  dearest friends if I went on:&mdash;let them rather, with Bailie Jarvie's
  true conscience,<a name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> take
  their Scott from the inner shelf in their heart's library which all true
  Scotsmen give him, and trace, with the swift reading of memory, the
  characters of Fergus M'Ivor, Hector M'Intyre, Mause Headrigg, Alison
  Wilson, Richie <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span> Moniplies, and Andrew Fairservice; and
  then say, if the faults of all these, drawn as they are with a precision
  of touch like a Corinthian sculptor's of the acanthus leaf, can be found
  in anything like the same strength in other races, or if so stubbornly
  folded and starched moni-plies of irritating kindliness, selfish
  friendliness, lowly conceit, and intolerable fidelity, are native to any
  other spot of the wild earth of the habitable globe.</p>

  <p>10. Will you note also&mdash;for this is of extreme
  interest&mdash;that these essential faults are all mean
  faults;&mdash;what we may call ground-growing faults; conditions of
  semi-education, of hardly-treated homelife, or of coarsely-minded and
  wandering prosperity. How literally may we go back from the living soul
  symbolized, to the strangely accurate earthly symbol, in the prickly
  weed. For if, with its bravery of endurance, and carelessness in choice
  of home, we find also definite faculty and habit of migration, volant
  mechanism for choiceless journey, not divinely directed in pilgrimage to
  known shrines; but carried at the wind's will by a Spirit which listeth
  <i>not</i>&mdash;it will go hard but that the plant shall become, if not
  dreaded, at least despised; and, in its wandering and reckless splendour,
  disgrace the garden of the sluggard, and possess the inheritance of the
  prodigal: until even its own nature seems contrary to good, and the
  invocation of the just man be made to it as the executor of Judgment,
  "Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley."</p>

  <p>11. Yet to be despised&mdash;either for men or flowers&mdash;may <!--

  no ill-fortune; the real ill-fortune is only to be despicable. These
  faults of human character, wherever found, observe, belong to it as
  ill-trained&mdash;incomplete; confirm themselves only in the vulgar.
  There is no base pertinacity, no overweening conceit, in the Black
  Douglas, or Claverhouse, or Montrose; in these we find the pure Scottish
  temper, of heroic endurance and royal pride; but, when, in the pay, and
  not deceived, but purchased, idolatry of Mammon, the Scottish persistence
  and pride become knit and vested in the spleuchan, and your stiff
  Covenanter makes his covenant with Death, and your Old Mortality
  deciphers only the senseless legends of the eternal gravestone,&mdash;you
  get your weed, earth-grown, in bitter verity, and earth-devastating, in
  bitter strength.</p>

  <p>12. I have told you, elsewhere, we are always first to study national
  character in the highest and purest examples. But if our knowledge is to
  be complete, we have to study also the special diseases of national
  character. And in exact opposition to the most solemn virtue of Scotland,
  the domestic truth and tenderness breathed in all Scottish song, you have
  this special disease and mortal cancer, this woody-fibriness, literally,
  of temper and thought: the consummation of which into pure lignite, or
  rather black Devil's charcoal&mdash;the sap of the birks of Aberfeldy
  become cinder, and the blessed juices of them, deadly gas,&mdash;you may
  know in its pure blackness best in the work of the greatest of these
  ground-growing Scotchmen, Adam Smith. <!-- Page 125 --><span

  <p>13. No man of like capacity, I believe, born of any other nation,
  could have deliberately, and with no momentary shadow of suspicion or
  question, formalized the spinous and monstrous fallacy that human
  commerce and policy are <i>naturally</i> founded on the desire of every
  man to possess his neighbour's goods.</p>

  <p><i>This</i> is the 'release unto us Barabbas,' with a witness; and the
  deliberate systematization of that cry, and choice, for perpetual
  repetition and fulfilment in Christian statesmanship, has been, with the
  strange precision of natural symbolism and retribution, signed, (as of
  old, by strewing of ashes on Kidron,) by strewing of ashes on the brooks
  of Scotland; waters once of life, health, music, and divine tradition;
  but to whose festering scum you may now set fire with a candle; and of
  which, round the once excelling palace of Scotland, modern sanitary
  science is now helplessly contending with the poisonous exhalations.</p>

  <p>14. I gave this chapter its heading, because I had it in my mind to
  work out the meaning of the fable in the ninth chapter of Judges, from
  what I had seen on that thorny ground of mine, where the bramble was king
  over all the trees of the wood. But the thoughts are gone from me now;
  and as I re-read the chapter of Judges,&mdash;now, except in my memory,
  unread, as it chances, for many a year,&mdash;the sadness of that story
  of Gideon fastens on me, and silences me. <i>This</i> the end of his
  angel visions, and dream-led victories, the slaughter of all his <!--

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE STEM.</p>

  <p>1. As I read over again, with a fresh mind, the last chapter, I am
  struck by the opposition of states which seem best to fit a weed for a
  weed's work,&mdash;stubbornness, namely, and flaccidity. On the one hand,
  a sternness and a coarseness of structure which changes its stem into a
  stake, and its leaf into a spine; on the other, an utter flaccidity and
  ventosity of structure, which changes its stem into a riband, and its
  leaf into a bubble. And before we go farther&mdash;for we are not yet at
  the end of our study of these obnoxious things&mdash;we had better
  complete an examination of the parts of a plant in general, by
  ascertaining what a Stem proper is; and what makes it stiffer, or
  hollower, than we like it;&mdash;how, to wit, the gracious and generous
  strength of ash differs from the spinous obstinacy of
  blackthorn,&mdash;and how the geometric and enduring hollowness of a
  stalk of wheat differs from the soft fulness of that of a mushroom. To
  which end, I will take up a piece of study, not of black, but white,
  thorn, written last spring. <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>[128]</span></p>

  <p>2. I suppose there is no question but that all nice people like
  hawthorn blossom.</p>

  <p>I want, if I can, to find out to-day, 25th May, 1875, what it is we
  like it so much for: holding these two branches of it in my
  hand&mdash;one full out, the other in youth. This full one is a mere mass
  of symmetrically balanced&mdash;snow, one was going vaguely to write, in
  the first impulse. But it is nothing of the sort. White,&mdash;yes, in a
  high degree; and pure, totally; but not at all dazzling in the white, nor
  pure in an insultingly rivalless manner, as snow would be; yet pure
  somehow, certainly; and white, absolutely, in spite of what might be
  thought failure,&mdash;imperfection&mdash;nay, even distress and loss in
  it. For every little rose of it has a green darkness in the
  centre&mdash;not even a pretty green, but a faded, yellowish, glutinous,
  unaccomplished green; and round that, all over the surface of the
  blossom, whose shell-like petals are themselves deep sunk, with grey
  shadows in the hollows of them&mdash;all above this already subdued
  brightness, are strewn the dark points of the dead stamens&mdash;manifest
  more and more, the longer one looks, as a kind of grey sand, sprinkled
  without sparing over what looked at first unspotted light. And in all the
  ways of it the lovely thing is more like the spring frock of some prudent
  little maid of fourteen, than a flower;&mdash;frock with some little
  spotty pattern on it to keep it from showing an unintended and
  inadvertent spot,&mdash;if Fate should ever inflict such a thing!
  Undeveloped, thinks Mr. Darwin,&mdash;the poor <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>[129]</span> short-coming,
  ill-blanched thorn blossom&mdash;going to be a Rose, some day soon; and,
  what next?&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps a Pæony!</p>

  <p>3. Then this next branch, in dawn and delight of youth, set with
  opening clusters of yet numerable blossom, four, and five, and seven,
  edged, and islanded, and ended, by the sharp leaves of freshest green,
  deepened under the flowers, and studded round with bosses, better than
  pearl beads of St. Agnes' rosary,&mdash;folded, over and over, with the
  edges of their little leaves pouting, as the very softest waves do on
  flat sand where one meets another; then opening just enough to show the
  violet colour within&mdash;which yet isn't violet colour, nor even "meno
  che le rose," but a different colour from every other lilac that one ever
  saw;&mdash;faint and faded even before it sees light, as the filmy cup
  opens over the depth of it, then broken into purple motes of tired bloom,
  fading into darkness, as the cup extends into the perfect rose.</p>

  <p>This, with all its sweet change that one would so fain stay, and soft
  effulgence of bud into softly falling flower, one has watched&mdash;how
  often; but always with the feeling that the blossoms are thrown over the
  green depth like white clouds&mdash;never with any idea of so much as
  asking what holds the cloud there. Have each of the innumerable blossoms
  a separate stalk? and, if so, how is it that one never thinks of the
  stalk, as one does with currants?</p>

  <p>4. Turn the side of the branch to you;&mdash;Nature never meant you to
  see it so; but now it is all stalk below, and <!-- Page 130 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>[130]</span> stamens
  above,&mdash;the petals nothing, the stalks all tiny trees, always
  dividing their branches mainly into three&mdash;one in the centre short,
  and the two lateral, long, with an intermediate extremely long one, if
  needed, to fill a gap, so contriving that the flowers shall all be nearly
  at the same level, or at least surface of ball, like a guelder rose. But
  the cunning with which the tree conceals its structure till the blossom
  is fallen, and then&mdash;for a little while, we had best look no more at
  it, for it is all like grape-stalks with no grapes.</p>

  <p>These, whether carrying hawthorn blossom and haw, or grape blossom and
  grape, or peach blossom and peach, you will simply call the 'stalk,'
  whether of flower or fruit. A 'stalk' is essentially round, like a
  pillar; and has, for the most part, the power of first developing, and
  then shaking off, flower and fruit from its extremities. You can pull the
  peach from its stalk, the cherry, the grape. Always at some time of its
  existence, the flower-stalk lets fall something of what it sustained,
  petal or seed.</p>

  <p>In late Latin it is called 'petiolus,' the little foot; because the
  expanding piece that holds the grape, or olive, is a little like an
  animal's foot. Modern botanists have misapplied the word to the
  <i>leaf</i>-stalk, which has no resemblance to a foot at all. We must
  keep the word to its proper meaning, and, when we want to write Latin,
  call it 'petiolus;' when we want to write English, call it 'stalk,'
  meaning always fruit or flower stalk. <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>[131]</span></p>

  <p>I cannot find when the word 'stalk' first appears in
  English:&mdash;its derivation will be given presently.</p>

  <p>5. Gather next a hawthorn leaf. That also has a stalk; but you can't
  shake the leaf off it. It, and the leaf, are essentially one; for the
  sustaining fibre runs up into every ripple or jag of the leaf's edge: and
  its section is different from that of the flower-stalk; it is no more
  round, but has an upper and under surface, quite different from each
  other. It will be better, however, to take a larger leaf to examine this
  structure in. Cabbage, cauliflower, or rhubarb, would any of them be
  good, but don't grow wild in the luxuriance I want. So, if you please, we
  will take a leaf of burdock, (Arctium Lappa,) the principal business of
  that plant being clearly to grow leaves wherewith to adorn
  fore-grounds.<a name="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

  <p>6. The outline of it in Sowerby is not an intelligent one, and I have
  not time to draw it but in the rudest way myself; Fig. 13, <i>a</i>; with
  perspectives of the elementary form below, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and
  <i>d</i>. By help of which, if you will construct a burdock leaf in
  paper, my rude outline (<i>a</i>) may tell the rest of what I want you to
  see.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 14.
  </div>
  <p>Take a sheet of stout note paper, Fig. 14, A, double it sharply down
  the centre, by the dotted line, then give it the two cuts at <i>a</i> and
  <i>b</i>, and double those pieces sharply back, as at B; then, opening
  them again, cut the whole <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>[132]</span> into the form C; and then, pulling up the
  corners <i>c d</i>, stitch them together with a loose thread so that the
  points <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> shall be within half an inch of each other;
  and you will have a kind of triangular scoop, or shovel, with a stem, by
  which you can sufficiently hold it, D.</p>

  <p>7. And from this easily constructed and tenable model, you may learn
  at once these following main facts about all leaves. <!-- Page 133
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[133]</span></p>

  <p>[I.] That they are not flat, but, however slightly, always hollowed
  into craters, or raised into hills, in one or another direction; so that
  any drawable outline of them does not in the least represent the real
  extent of their surfaces; and until you know how to draw a cup, or a
  mountain, rightly, you have no chance of drawing a leaf. My simple artist
  readers of long ago, when I told them to draw leaves, thought they could
  do them by the boughfull, whenever they liked. Alas, except by old
  William Hunt, and Burne Jones, I've not seen a leaf painted, since those
  burdocks of Turner's; far less sculptured&mdash;though one would think at
  first that was easier! Of which we shall have talk elsewhere; here I must
  go on to note fact number two, concerning leaves.</p>

<p><!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span></p>

  <p>8. [II.] The strength of their supporting stem consists not merely in
  the gathering together of all the fibres, but in gathering them
  essentially into the profile of the letter V, which you will see your
  doubled paper stem has; and of which you can feel the strength and use,
  in your hand, as you hold it. Gather a common plantain leaf, and look at
  the way it puts its round ribs together at the base, and you will
  understand the matter at once. The arrangement is modified and disguised
  in every possible way, according to the leaf's need: in the aspen, the
  leaf-stalk becomes an absolute vertical plank; and in the large trees is
  often almost rounded into the likeness of a fruit-stalk;&mdash;but, in
  all,<a name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> the essential
  structure is this doubled one; and in all, it opens at the place where
  the leaf joins the main stem, into a kind of cup, which holds next year's
  bud in the hollow of it.</p>

  <p>9. Now there would be no inconvenience in your simply getting into the
  habit of calling the round petiol of the fruit the 'stalk,' and the
  contracted channel of the leaf, 'leaf-stalk.' But this way of naming them
  would not enforce, nor fasten in your mind, the difference between the
  two, so well as if you have an entirely different name for the
  leaf-stalk. Which is the more desirable, because the limiting character
  of the leaf, botanically, is&mdash;(I only learned this from my botanical
  friend the other day, just <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135"></a>[135]</span> in the very moment I wanted
  it,)&mdash;that it holds the bud of the new stem in its own hollow, but
  cannot itself grow in the hollow of anything else;&mdash;or, in botanical
  language, leaves are never axillary,&mdash;don't grow in armpits, but are
  themselves armpits; hollows, that is to say, where they spring from the
  main stem.</p>

  <p>10. Now there is already a received and useful botanical word, 'cyme'
  (which we shall want in a little while.) derived from the Greek <span
  title="kuma" class="grk">&kappa;&#x1FE6;&mu;&alpha;</span>, a swelling or
  rising wave, and used to express a swelling cluster of foamy blossom.
  Connected with that word, but in a sort the reverse of it, you have the
  Greek '<span title="kumbê" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F7B;&mu;&beta;&eta;</span>,' the <i>hollow</i> of a cup, or
  bowl; whence <span title="kumbalou" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F7B;&mu;&beta;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>, a
  cymbal,&mdash;that is to say, a musical instrument owing its tone to its
  <i>hollowness</i>. These words become in Latin, cymba, and cymbalum; and
  I think you will find it entirely convenient and advantageous to call the
  leaf-stalk distinctively the 'cymba,' retaining the mingled idea of cup
  and boat, with respect at least to the part of it that holds the bud; and
  understanding that it gathers itself into a V-shaped, or even narrowly
  vertical, section, as a boat narrows to its bow, for strength to sustain
  the leaf.</p>

  <p>With this word you may learn the Virgilian line, that shows the final
  use of iron&mdash;or iron-darkened&mdash;ships:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Et ferrugíneâ subvectat corpora cymbâ."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The "subvectat corpora" will serve to remind you of the office of the
  leafy cymba in carrying the bud; and make <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[136]</span> you thankful that the
  said leafy vase is not of iron; and is a ship of Life instead of
  Death.</p>

  <p>11. Already, not once, nor twice, I have had to use the word 'stem,'
  of the main round branch from which both stalk and cymba spring. This
  word you had better keep for all growing, or advancing, shoots of trees,
  whether from the ground, or from central trunks and branches. I regret
  that the words multiply on us; but each that I permit myself to use has
  its own proper thought or idea to express, as you will presently
  perceive; so that true knowledge multiplies with true words.</p>

  <p>12. The 'stem,' you are to say, then, when you mean the
  <i>advancing</i> shoot,&mdash;which lengthens annually, while a stalk
  ends every year in a blossom, and a cymba in a leaf. A stem is
  essentially round,<a name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
  square, or regularly polygonal; though, as a cymba may become
  exceptionally round, a stem may become exceptionally flat, or even mimic
  the shape of a leaf. Indeed I should have liked to write "a stem is
  essentially round, and constructively, on occasion, square,"&mdash;but it
  would have been too grand. The fact is, however, that a stem is really a
  roundly minded thing, throwing off its branches in circles as a trundled
  mop throws off drops, though it can always order the branches to fly off
  in what order it likes,&mdash;two at a time, opposite to each other; or
  three, or five, in a spiral coil; or one here and one there, on this side
  and that; <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>[137]</span> but it is always twisting, in its own
  inner mind and force; hence it is especially proper to use the word
  'stem' of it&mdash;<span title="stemma" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&#x1F73;&mu;&mu;&alpha;</span>, a twined wreath; properly,
  twined round a staff, or sceptre: therefore, learn at once by heart these
  lines in the opening Iliad:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"<span title="Stemmat' echôn en chersin hekêbolou Apollônos," class="grk">&Sigma;&tau;&#x1F73;&mu;&mu;&alpha;&tau;' &#x1F14;&chi;&omega;&nu; &#x1F10;&nu; &chi;&epsilon;&rho;&sigma;&#x1F76;&nu; &#x1F11;&kappa;&eta;&beta;&#x1F79;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon; &#x1F08;&pi;&#x1F79;&lambda;&lambda;&omega;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;,</span></p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And recollect that a sceptre is properly a staff to lean upon; and
  that as a crown or diadem is first a binding thing, a 'sceptre' is first
  a <i>supporting</i> thing, and it is in its nobleness, itself made of the
  stem of a young tree. You may just as well learn also this:</p>

  <p>13. The supporting power in the tree itself is, I doubt not, greatly
  increased by this spiral action; and the fine <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[138]</span> instinct of its being
  so, caused the twisted pillar to be used in the Lombardic
  Gothic,&mdash;at first, merely as a pleasant variety of form, but at last
  constructively and universally, by Giotto, and all the architects of his
  school. Not that the spiral form actually adds to the strength of a
  Lombardic pillar, by imitating contortions of wood, any more than the
  fluting of a Doric shaft adds to its strength by imitating the
  canaliculation of a reed; but the perfect action of the imagination,
  which had adopted the encircling acanthus for the capital, adopted the
  twining stemma for the shaft; the pure delight of the eye being the first
  condition in either case: and it is inconceivable how much of the
  pleasure taken both in ornament and in natural form is founded
  elementarily on groups of spiral line. The study in our fifth plate, of
  the involucre of the waste-thistle,<a name="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> is as good an example as I can give of
  the more subtle and concealed conditions of this structure.</p>

  <p>14. Returning to our present business of nomenclature, we find the
  Greek word, 'stemma,' adopted by the Latins, <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[139]</span> becoming the
  expression of a growing and hereditary race; and the branched tree, the
  natural type, among all nations, of multiplied families. Hence the entire
  fitness of the word for our present purposes; as signifying, "a spiral
  shoot extending itself by branches." But since, unless it is spiral, it
  is not a stem, and unless it has branches, it is not a stem, we shall
  still want another word for the sustaining 'sceptre' of a foxglove, or
  cowslip. Before determining that, however, we must see what need there
  may be of one familiar to our ears until lately, although now, I
  understand, falling into disuse.</p>

  <p>15. By our definition, a stem is a spirally bent, essentially living
  and growing, shoot of vegetation. But the branch of a tree, in which many
  such stems have their origin, is not, except in a very subtle and partial
  way, spiral; nor, except in the shoots that spring from it, progressive
  forwards; it only receives increase of thickness at its sides. Much more,
  what used to be called the <i>trunk</i> of a tree, in which many branches
  are united, has ceased to be, except in mere tendency and temper, spiral;
  and has so far ceased from growing as to be often in a state of decay in
  its interior, while the external layers are still in serviceable
  strength.</p>

  <p>16. If, however, a trunk were only to be defined as an arrested stem,
  or a cluster of arrested stems, we might perhaps refuse, in scientific
  use, the popular word. But such a definition does not touch the main
  idea. Branches usually begin to assert themselves at a height above the
  <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[140]</span>
  ground approximately fixed for each species of tree,&mdash;low in an oak,
  high in a stone pine; but, in both, marked as a point of <i>structural
  change in the direction of growing force</i>, like the spring of a vault
  from a pillar; and as the tree grows old, some of its branches getting
  torn away by winds or falling under the weight of their own fruit, or
  load of snow, or by natural decay, there remains literally a 'truncated'
  mass of timber, still bearing irregular branches here and there, but
  inevitably suggestive of resemblance to a human body, after the loss of
  some of its limbs.</p>

  <p>And to prepare trees for their practical service, what age and storm
  only do partially, the first rough process of human art does completely.
  The branches are lopped away, leaving literally the 'truncus' as the part
  of the tree out of which log and rafter can be cut. And in many trees, it
  would appear to be the chief end of their being to produce this part of
  their body on a grand scale, and of noble substance; so that, while in
  thinking of vegetable life without reference to its use to men or
  animals, we should rightly say that the essence of it was in leaf and
  flower&mdash;not in trunk or fruit; yet for the sake of animals, we find
  that some plants, like the vine, are apparently meant chiefly to produce
  fruit; others, like laurels, chiefly to produce leaves; others chiefly to
  produce flowers; and others to produce permanently serviceable and
  sculptural wood; or, in some cases, merely picturesque and monumental
  masses of vegetable rock, "intertwisted <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span> fibres
  serpentine,"&mdash;of far nobler and more pathetic use in their places,
  and their enduring age, than ever they could be for material purpose in
  human habitation. For this central mass of the vegetable organism, then,
  the English word 'trunk' and French 'tronc' are always in accurate
  scholarship to be retained&mdash;meaning the part of a tree which remains
  when its branches are lopped away.</p>

  <p>17. We have now got distinct ideas of four different kinds of stem,
  and simple names for them in Latin and English,&mdash;Petiolus, Cymba,
  Stemma, and Truncus; Stalk, Leaf-stalk, Stem, and Trunk; and these are
  all that we shall commonly need. There is, however, one more that will be
  sometimes necessary, though it is ugly and difficult to pronounce, and
  must be as little used as we can.</p>

  <p>And here I must ask you to learn with me a little piece of Roman
  history. I say, to <i>learn</i> with me, because I don't know any Roman
  history except the two first books of Livy, and little bits here and
  there of the following six or seven. I only just know enough about it to
  be able to make out the bearings and meaning of any fact that I now
  learn. The greater number of modern historians know, (if honest enough
  even for that,) the facts, or something that may possibly be like the
  facts, but haven't the least notion of the meaning of them. So that,
  though I have to find out everything that I want in Smith's dictionary,
  like any schoolboy, I can usually tell you the <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[142]</span> significance of what I
  so find, better than perhaps even Mr. Smith himself could.</p>

  <p>18. In the 586th page of Mr. Smith's volume, you have it written that
  'Calvus,' bald-head, was the name of a family of the Licinia gens; that
  the man of whom we hear earliest, as so named, was the first plebeian
  elected to military tribuneship in <span class="scac">B.C</span>. 400;
  and that the fourth of whom we hear, was surnamed 'Stolo,' because he was
  so particular in pruning away the Stolons (stolones), or useless young
  shoots, of his vines.</p>

  <p>We must keep this word 'stolon,' therefore, for these young suckers
  springing from an old root. Its derivation is uncertain; but the main
  idea meant by it is one of uselessness,&mdash;sprouting without occasion
  or fruit; and the words 'stolidus' and 'stolid' are really its
  derivatives, though we have lost their sense in English by partly
  confusing them with 'solid' which they have nothing to do with. A
  'stolid' person is essentially a 'useless sucker' of society; frequently
  very leafy and graceful, but with no good in him.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/fig15.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig15.png"
      alt="Fig. 15." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 15.
  </div>
  <p>19. Nevertheless, I won't allow our vegetable 'stolons' to be
  despised. Some of quite the most beautiful forms of leafage belong to
  them;&mdash;even the foliage of the olive itself is never seen to the
  same perfection on the upper branches as in the young ground-rods in
  which the dual groups of leaves crowd themselves in their haste into
  clusters of three.</p>

  <p>But, for our point of Latin history, remember always <!-- Page 143
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[143]</span> that in 400
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, just a year before the death of Socrates
  at Athens, this family of Stolid persons manifested themselves at Rome,
  shooting up from plebeian roots into places where they had no business;
  and preparing the way for the degradation of the entire Roman race under
  the Empire; their success being owed, remember also, to the faults of the
  patricians, for one of the laws passed by Calvus Stolo was that the
  Sibylline books should be in custody of ten men, of whom five should be
  plebeian, "that no falsifications might be introduced in favour of the
  patricians."</p>

  <p>20. All this time, however, we have got no name for the prettiest of
  all stems,&mdash;that of annual flowers growing high from among their
  ground leaves, like lilies of the valley, and saxifrages, and the tall
  primulas&mdash;of which this pretty type, Fig. 15, was cut for me by Mr.
  Burgess years ago; admirable in its light outline of the foamy globe of
  flowers, supported and balanced in the meadow breezes on that elastic rod
  of slenderest life.</p>

  <p>What shall we call it? We had better rest from our study of terms a
  little, and do a piece of needful classifying, before we try to name
  it.</p>

  <p>21. My younger readers will find it easy to learn, and convenient to
  remember, for a beginning of their science, <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>[144]</span> the names of twelve
  great families of cinquefoiled flowers,<a name="NtA_39"

  for the most part golden, the second, blue, the third, purple, and the
  fourth, red.</p>

  <p>And their names, by simple lips, can be pleasantly said, or sung, in
  this order, the two first only being a little difficult to get over.</p>

  <p>22. I do not care much to assert or debate my reasons for the changes
  of nomenclature made in this list. The <!-- Page 145 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[145]</span> most gratuitous is
  that of 'Lucy' for 'Gentian,' because the King of Macedon, from whom the
  flower has been so long named, was by no means a person deserving of so
  consecrated memory. I conceive no excuse needed for rejecting Caryophyll,
  one of the crudest and absurdest words ever coined by unscholarly men of
  science; or Papilionaceæ, which is unendurably long for pease; and when
  we are now writing Latin, in a sentimental temper, and wish to say that
  we gathered a daisy, we shall not any more be compelled to write that we
  gathered a 'Bellidem perennem,' or, an 'Oculum Diei.'</p>

  <p>I take the pure Latin form, Margarita, instead of Margareta, in memory
  of Margherita of Cortona,<a name="NtA_40"
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> as well as of the great saint: also the
  tiny scatterings and sparklings of the daisy on the turf may remind us of
  the old use of the word 'Margaritæ,' for the minute particles of the Host
  sprinkled on the patina&mdash;"Has particulas <span title="meridas" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F77;&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span> vocat
  Euchologium, <span title="margaritas" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F77;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>
  Liturgia Chrysostomi."<a name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
  My young German readers will, I hope, call the flower
  Gretschen,&mdash;unless they would uproot the daisies of the Rhine, lest
  French girls should also count their love-lots by the Marguerite. I must
  be so ungracious to my fair young readers, however, as to <span
  class="correction" title="'warm' in original">warn</span> them that this
  trial of their lovers is a very favourable one, for, in nine blossoms out
  of <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>[146]</span> ten, the leaves of the Marguerite are
  odd, so that, if they are only gracious enough to begin with the
  supposition that he loves them, they must needs end in the conviction of
  it.</p>

  <p>23. I am concerned, however, for the present, only with my first or
  golden order, of which the Roof-foil, or house-leek, is called in present
  botany, Sedum, 'the squatter,' because of its way of fastening itself
  down on stones, or roof, as close as it can sit. But I think this an
  ungraceful notion of its behaviour; and as its blossoms are, of all
  flowers, the most sharply and distinctly star-shaped, I shall call it
  'Stella' (providing otherwise, in due time, for the poor little
  chickweeds;) and the common stonecrop will therefore be 'Stella
  domestica.'</p>

  <p>The second tribe, (at present saxifraga,) growing for the most part
  wild on rocks, may, I trust, even in Protestant botany, be named
  Francesca, after St. Francis of Assisi; not only for its modesty, and
  love of mountain ground, and poverty of colour and leaf; but also because
  the chief element of its decoration, seen close, will be found in its
  spots, or stigmata.</p>

  <p>In the nomenclature of the third order I make no change.</p>

  <p>24. Now all this group of golden-blossoming plants agree in general
  character of having a rich cluster of radical leaves, from which they
  throw up a single stalk bearing clustered blossoms; for which stalk, when
  entirely leafless, I intend always to keep the term 'virgula,' the <!--
  Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span>
  'little rod'&mdash;not painfully caring about it, but being able thus to
  define it with precision, if required. And these are connected with the
  stems of branching shrubs through infinite varieties of structure, in
  which the first steps of transition are made by carrying the cluster of
  radical leaves up, and letting them expire gradually from the rising
  stem: the changes of form in the leaves as they rise higher from the
  ground being one of quite the most interesting specific studies in every
  plant. I had set myself once, in a bye-study for foreground drawing, hard
  on this point; and began, with Mr. Burgess, a complete analysis of the
  foliation of annual stems; of which Line-studies II., III., and IV., are
  examples; reduced copies, all, from the beautiful Flora Danica. But after
  giving two whole lovely long summer days, under the Giesbach, to the blue
  scabious, ('Devil's bit,') and getting in that time, only half-way up it,
  I gave in; and must leave the work to happier and younger souls.</p>

  <p>25. For these flowering stems, therefore, possessing nearly all the
  complex organization of a tree, but not its permanence, we will keep the
  word 'virga;' and 'virgula' for those that have no leaves. I believe,
  when we come to the study of leaf-order, it will be best to begin with
  these annual virgæ, in which the leaf has nothing to do with preparation
  for a next year's branch. And now the remaining terms commonly applied to
  stems may be for the most part dispensed with; but several are
  interesting, and must be examined before dismissal. <!-- Page 148
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[148]</span></p>

  <p><a name="c8p26"></a> 26. Indeed, in the first place, the word we have
  to use so often, 'stalk,' has not been got to the roots of, yet. It comes
  from the Greek <span title="stelechos," class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&#x1F73;&lambda;&epsilon;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;,</span>
  (stelechos,) the 'holding part' of a tree, that which is like a handle to
  all its branches; 'stock' is another form in which it has come down to
  us: with some notion of its being the mother of branches: thus, when
  Athena's olive was burnt by the Persians, two days after, a shoot a cubit
  long had sprung from the 'stelechos,' of it.</p>

  <p>27. Secondly. Few words are more interesting to the modern scholarly
  and professorial mind than 'stipend.' (I have twice a year at present to
  consider whether I am worth mine, sent with compliments from the Curators
  of the University chest). Now, this word comes from 'stips,' small pay,
  which itself comes from 'stipo,' to press together, with the idea of
  small coin heaped up in little towers or piles. But with the idea of
  lateral pressing together, instead of downward, we get 'stipes,' a solid
  log; in Greek, with the same sense, <span title="stupos," class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&#x1F7B;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;,</span> (stupos,) whence,
  gradually, with help from another word meaning to beat, (and a
  side-glance at beating of hemp,) we get our 'stupid,' the German stumph,
  the Scottish sumph, and the plain English 'stump.'</p>

  <p>Refining on the more delicate sound of stipes, the Latins got
  'stipula,' the thin stem of straw: which rustles and ripples daintily in
  verse, associated with spica and spiculum, used of the sharp pointed ear
  of corn, and its fine processes of fairy shafts. <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>[149]</span></p>

  <p>28. There are yet two more names of stalk to be studied, though,
  except for particular plants, not needing to be used,&mdash;namely, the
  Latin cau-dex, and cau-lis, both connected with the Greek <span
  title="kaulos" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&upsilon;&lambda;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, properly meaning
  a solid stalk like a handle, passing into the sense of the hilt of a
  sword, or quill of a pen. Then, in Latin, caudex passes into the sense of
  log, and so, of cut plank or tablet of wood; thus finally becoming the
  classical 'codex' of writings engraved on such wooden tablets, and
  therefore generally used for authoritative manuscripts.</p>

  <p>Lastly, 'caulis,' retained accurately in our cauliflower, contracted
  in 'colewort,' and refined in 'kail,' softens itself into the French
  'chou,' meaning properly the whole family of thick-stalked eatable salads
  with spreading heads; but these being distinguished explicitly by Pliny
  as 'Capitati,' 'salads with a head,' or 'Captain salads,' the mediæval
  French softened the 'caulis capitatus' into 'chou cabus;'&mdash;or, to
  separate the round or apple-like mass of leaves from the flowery foam,
  'cabus' simply, by us at last enriched and emphasized into 'cabbage.'</p>

  <p>29. I believe we have now got through the stiffest piece of etymology
  we shall have to master in the course of our botany; but I am certain
  that young readers will find patient work, in this kind, well rewarded by
  the groups of connected thoughts which will thus attach themselves to
  familiar names; and their grasp of every language they learn must only be
  esteemed by them secure when they recognize its derivatives in these
  homely associations, <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>[150]</span> and are as much at ease with the Latin or
  French syllables of a word as with the English ones; this familiarity
  being above all things needful to cure our young students of their
  present ludicrous impression that what is simple, in English, is knowing,
  in Greek; and that terms constructed out of a dead language will explain
  difficulties which remained insoluble in a living one. But Greek is
  <i>not</i> yet dead: while if we carry our unscholarly nomenclature much
  further, English soon will be; and then doubtless botanical gentlemen at
  Athens will for some time think it fine to describe what we used to call
  caryophyllaceæ, as the <span title="hedlêphides" class="grk"
  >&#x1F11;&delta;&lambda;&eta;&phi;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>

  <p>30. For indeed we are all of us yet but school-boys, clumsily using
  alike our lips and brains; and with all our mastery of instruments and
  patience of attention, but few have reached, and those dimly, the first
  level of science,&mdash;wonder.</p>

  <p>For the first instinct of the stem,&mdash;unnamed by us
  yet&mdash;unthought of,&mdash;the instinct of seeking light, as of the
  root to seek darkness,&mdash;what words can enough speak the wonder of
  it.</p>

  <p>Look. Here is the little thing, Line-study V. (A), in its first birth
  to us: the stem of stems; the one of which we pray that it may bear our
  daily bread. The seed has fallen in the ground with the springing germ of
  it downwards; with heavenly cunning the taught stem curls round, and
  seeks the never-seen light. Veritable 'conversion,' miraculous, called of
  God. And here is the oat <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>[151]</span> germ, (B)&mdash;after the wheat, most
  vital of divine gifts; and assuredly, in days to come, fated to grow on
  many a naked rock in hitherto lifeless lands, over which the glancing
  sheaves of it will shake sweet treasure of innocent gold.</p>

  <p>And who shall tell us how they grow; and the fashion of their rustling
  pillars&mdash;bent, and again erect, at every breeze. Fluted shaft or
  clustered pier, how poor of art, beside this grass-shaft&mdash;built,
  first to sustain the food of men, then to be strewn under their feet!</p>

  <p>We must not stay to think of it, yet, or we shall get no farther till
  harvest has come and gone again. And having our names of stems now
  determined enough, we must in next chapter try a little to understand the
  different kinds of them.</p>

  <p>The following notes, among many kindly sent me on the subject of
  Scottish Heraldry, seem to be the most trustworthy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The earliest known mention of the thistle as the national badge of
  Scotland is in the inventory of the effects of James III., who probably
  adopted it as an appropriate illustration of the royal motto, <i>In
  defence</i>.</p>

  <p>"Thistles occur on the coins of James IV., Mary, James V., and James

  thistles, with an oval badge attached. <!-- Page 152 --><span

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

  <p>1. The elementary study of methods of growth, given in the following
  chapter, has been many years written, (the greater part soon after the
  fourth volume of 'Modern Painters'); and ought now to be rewritten
  entirely; but having no time to do this, I leave it with only a word or
  two of modification, because some truth and clearness of incipient notion
  will be conveyed by it to young readers, from which I can afterwards lop
  the errors, and into which I can graft the finer facts, better than if I
  had a less blunt embryo to begin with.</p>

  <p>2. A stem, then, broadly speaking, (I had thus began the old chapter,)
  is the channel of communication between the leaf and root; and if the
  leaf can grow directly from the root there is no stem: so that it is well
  first to conceive of all plants as consisting of leaves and roots only,
  with the condition that each leaf must have its own quite particular
  root<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> somewhere. <!--
  Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>[154]</span> Let
  a b c, Fig. 16, be three leaves, each, as you see, with its own root, and
  by no means dependent on other leaves for its daily bread; and let the
  horizontal line be the surface of the ground. Then the plant has no stem,
  or an underground one. But if the three leaves rise above the ground, as
  in Fig. 17, they must reach their roots by elongating their stalks, and
  this elongation is the stem of the plant. If the outside leaves grow
  last, and are therefore youngest, the plant is said to grow from the
  outside. You know that 'ex' means out, and that 'gen' is the first
  syllable of Genesis (or creation), therefore the old botanists, putting
  an o between the two syllables, called plants whose outside leaves grew
  last, Ex-o-gens. If the inside leaf grows last, and is youngest, the
  plant was said to grow from the inside, and from the Greek Endon, within,
  called an 'Endo-gen.' If these names are persisted in, the Greek
  botanists, to return the compliment, will of course call Endogens <span
  title="Inseidbornides" class="grk"
  >&#x1F38;&nu;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&beta;&omicron;&rho;&nu;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,
  and Exogens <span title="Houtseidbornides" class="grk"
  >&#x1F4D;&upsilon;&tau;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&beta;&omicron;&rho;&nu;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>.
  In the Oxford school, they will be called simply Inlaid and Outlaid.</p>

      alt="Fig. 18. Ragged Robin." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 18.
  </div>
  <p>3. You see that if the outside leaves are to grow last, they may
  conveniently grow two at a time; which they accordingly do, and exogens
  always start with two little <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>[155]</span> leaves from their roots, and may
  therefore conveniently be called two-leaved; which, if you please, we
  will for our parts call them. The botanists call them 'two-suckered,' and
  can't be content to call them <i>that</i> in English; but drag in a long
  Greek word, meaning the fleshy sucker of the
  sea-devil,&mdash;'cotyledon,' which, however, I find is practically
  getting shortened into 'cot,' and that they will have to end by calling
  endogens, monocots, and exogens, bicots. I mean steadily to call them
  one-leaved and two-leaved, for this further reason, that they differ not
  merely in the single or dual springing of first leaves from the seed; but
  in the distinctly single or dual arrangement of leaves afterwards on the
  stem; so that, through all the complexity obtained by alternate and
  spiral placing, every bicot or two-leaved flower or tree is in reality
  composed of dual groups of leaves, separated by a given length of stem;
  as, most characteristically in this pure mountain type of the Ragged
  Robin (Clarissa laciniosa), Fig. 18; and compare A, and B, Line-study
  II.; while, on the other hand, the monocot plants are by close analysis,
  I think, always resolvable into successively climbing leaves, sessile on
  one another, and sending their roots, <!-- Page 156 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[156]</span> or processes, for
  nourishment, down through one another, as in Fig. 19.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/fig19.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig19.png"
      alt="Fig. 19. Monocot plant." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 19.
  </div>
  <p>4. Not that I am yet clear, at all, myself; but I do think it's more
  the botanists' fault than mine, what 'cotyledonous' structure there may
  be at the outer base of each successive bud; and still less, how the
  intervenient length of stem, in the bicots, is related to their power, or
  law, of branching. For not only the two-leaved tree is outlaid, and the
  one-leaved inlaid, but the two-leaved tree is branched, and the
  one-leaved tree is not branched. This is a most vital and important
  distinction, which I state to you in very bold terms, for though there
  are some apparent exceptions to the law, there are, I believe, no real
  ones, if we define a branch rightly. Thus, the head of a palm tree is
  merely a cluster of large leaves; and the spike of a grass, a clustered
  blossom. The stem, in both, is unbranched; and we should be able in this
  respect to classify plants very simply indeed, but for a provoking
  species of intermediate creatures whose branching is always in the manner
  of corals, or sponges, or arborescent minerals, irregular and accidental,
  and essentially, therefore, distinguished from the systematic anatomy of
  a truly branched tree. Of these presently; we must go on by very short
  steps: and I find no step can be taken without check from existing
  generalizations. Sowerby's definition of Monocotyledons, in his ninth
  volume, begins thus: "Herbs, (or rarely, and only in exotic genera,)
  trees, in which the wood, pith, and bark are indistinguishable." <!--
  Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>[157]</span> Now
  if there be one plant more than another in which the pith is defined, it
  is the common Rush; while the nobler families of true herbs derive their
  principal character from being pithless altogether! We cannot advance too
  slowly.</p>

  <p>5. In the families of one-leaved plants in which the young leaves grow
  directly out of the old ones, it becomes a grave question for them
  whether the old ones are to lie flat or edgeways, and whether they must
  therefore grow out of their faces or their edges. And we must at once
  understand the way they contrive it, in either case.</p>

      alt="Fig. 20. Arethusan leaf." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 20.
  </div>
  <p>Among the many forms taken by the Arethusan leaf, one of the commonest
  is long and gradually tapering,&mdash;much broader at the base than the
  point. We will take such an one for examination, and suppose that it is
  growing on the ground as in Fig. 20, with a root to its every fibre. Cut
  out a piece of strong paper roughly into the shape of this Arethusan
  leaf, a, Fig. 21. Now suppose the next young leaf has to spring out of
  the front of this one, at about the middle of its height. Give it two
  nicks with the scissors at b b; then roll up the lower part into a
  cylinder, (it will overlap a good deal at the bottom,) and tie it fast
  with a fine thread: so, you will get the form at c. Then bend the top of
  it back, so that, seen sideways, it appears as at d, and you see you have
  made quite a little flower-pot to plant your <!-- Page 158 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>[158]</span> new leaf in, and
  perhaps it may occur to you that you have seen something like this
  before. Now make another, a little less wide, but with the part for the
  cylinder twice as long, roll it up in the same way, and slip it inside
  the other, with the flat part turned the other way, e. Surely this
  reminds you now of something you have seen? Or must I draw the something
  (Fig. 22)?</p>

  <p>6. All grasses are thus constructed, and have their leaves set thus,
  opposite, on the sides of their tubular stems, alternately, as they
  ascend. But in most of them there is also a peculiar construction, by
  which, at the base of the sheath, or enclosing tube, each leaf
  articulates itself with the rest of the stem at a ringed knot, or joint.
  <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>
  <p>Before examining these, remember there are mainly two sorts of joints
  in the framework of the bodies of animals. One is that in which the bone
  is thick at the joints and thin between them, (see the bone of the next
  chicken leg you eat), the other is that of animals that have shells or
  horny coats, in which characteristically the shell is thin at the joints,
  and thick between them (look at the next lobster's claw you can see,
  without eating). You know, also, that though the crustaceous are titled
  only from their crusts, the name 'insect' is given to the whole insect
  tribe, because they are farther jointed almost into <i>sect</i>ions: it
  is easily remembered, also, that the projecting joint means strength and
  elasticity in the creature, and that all its limbs are useful to it, and
  cannot conveniently be parted with; and that the incised, sectional, or
  insectile joint means more or less weakness,<a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and necklace-like laxity or license in
  the creature's make; and an ignoble power of shaking off its legs or arms
  on occasion, coupled also with modes of growth involving occasionally
  quite astonishing transformations, and beginnings of new life under new
  circumstances; so that, until very lately, no mortal knew what a crab was
  like in its youth, the very existence <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>[160]</span> of the creature, as
  well as its legs, being jointed, as it were and made in separate pieces
  with the narrowest possible thread of connection between them; and its
  principal, or stomachic, period of life, connected with its sentimental
  period by as thin a thread as a wasp's stomach is with its thorax.</p>

  <p>7. Now in plants, as in animals, there are just the same opposed
  aspects of joint, with this specialty of difference in function, that the
  animal's limb bends at the joints, but the vegetable limb stiffens. And
  when the articulation projects, as in the joint of a cane, it means not
  only that the strength of the plant is well carried through the junction,
  but is carried farther and more safely than it could be without it: a
  cane is stronger, and can stand higher than it could otherwise, because
  of its joints. Also, this structure implies that the plant has a will of
  its own, and a position which on the whole it will keep, however it may
  now and then be bent out of it; and that it has a continual battle, of a
  healthy and humanlike kind, to wage with surrounding elements.</p>

  <p>But the crabby, or insect-like, joint, which you get in seaweeds and
  cacti, means either that the plant is to be dragged and wagged here and
  there at the will of waves, and to have no spring nor mind of its own; or
  else that it has at least no springy intention and elasticity of purpose,
  but only a knobby, knotty, prickly, malignant stubbornness, and
  incoherent opiniativeness; crawling about, and coggling, and grovelling,
  and aggregating <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>[161]</span> anyhow, like the minds of so many people
  whom one knows!</p>

  <p>8. Returning then to our grasses, in which the real rooting and
  junction of the leaves with each other is at these joints; we find that
  therefore every leaf of grass may be thought of as consisting of two main
  parts, for which we shall want two separate names. The lowest part, which
  wraps itself round to become strong, we will call the 'staff,' and for
  the free-floating outer part we will take specially the name given at
  present carelessly to a large number of the plants themselves, 'flag.'
  This will give a more clear meaning to the words 'rod' (virga), and
  'staff' (baculus), when they occur together, as in the 23rd Psalm; and
  remember the distinction is that a rod bends like a switch, but a staff
  is stiff. I keep the well-known name 'blade' for grass-leaves in their
  fresh green state.</p>

  <p>9. You felt, as you were bending down the paper into the form d, Fig.
  21, the difficulty and awkwardness of the transition from the tubular
  form of the staff to the flat one of the flag. The mode in which this
  change is effected is one of the most interesting features in plants, for
  you will find presently that the leaf-stalk in ordinary leaves is only a
  means of accomplishing the same change from round to flat. But you know I
  said just now that some leaves were not flat, but set upright, edgeways.
  It is not a common position in two-leaved trees; but if you can run out
  and look at an arbor vitæ, it may interest you <!-- Page 162 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>[162]</span> to see its
  hatchet-shaped vertically crested cluster of leaves transforming
  themselves gradually downwards into branches; and in one-leaved trees the
  vertically edged group is of great importance.</p>

  <p>10. Cut out another piece of paper like a in Fig. 21, but now, instead
  of merely giving it nicks at a, b, cut it into the shape A, Fig. 23. Roll
  the lower part up as before, but instead of pulling the upper part down,
  pinch its back at the dotted line, and bring the two points, a and b,
  forward, so that they may touch each other. B shows the look of the thing
  half-done, before the points a and b have quite met. Pinch them close,
  and stitch the two edges neatly together, all the way from a to the point
  c; then roll and tie up the lower part as before. You will find then that
  the back or spinal line of the whole leaf is bent forward, as at B. Now
  go out to the garden and gather the green leaf of a fleur-de-lys, and
  look at it and your piece of disciplined paper together; and I fancy you
  will probably find out several things for yourself that I want you to
  know.</p>

  <p><a name="c9p11"></a> 11. You see, for one thing, at once, how
  <i>strong</i> the fleur-de-lys leaf is, and that it is just twice as
  strong as a blade of grass, for it is the substance of the staff, with
  its sides flattened together, while the grass blade is a staff cut <!--
  Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>[163]</span> open
  and flattened out. And you see that as a grass blade necessarily flaps
  down, the fleur-de-lys leaf as necessarily curves up, owing to that
  inevitable bend in its back. And you see, with its keen edge, and long
  curve, and sharp point, how like a sword it is. The botanists would for
  once have given a really good and right name to the plants which have
  this kind of leaf, 'Ensatæ,' from the Latin 'ensis,' a sword; if only
  sata had been properly formed from sis. We can't let the rude Latin
  stand, but you may remember that the fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of
  chivalry, has a sword for its leaf, and a lily for its heart.</p>

  <p>12. In case you cannot gather a fleur-de-lys leaf, I have drawn for
  you, in Plate VI., a cluster of such leaves, which are as pretty as any,
  and so small that, missing the points of a few, I can draw them of their
  actual size. You see the pretty alternate interlacing at the bottom, and
  if you can draw at all, and will try to outline their curves, you will
  find what subtle lines they are. I did not know this name for the
  strong-edged grass leaves when I wrote the pieces about shield and sword
  leaves in 'Modern Painters'; I wish I had chanced in those passages on
  some other similitude, but I can't alter them now, and my trustful pupils
  may avoid all confusion of thought by putting gladius for ensis, and
  translating it by the word 'scymitar,' which is also more accurate in
  expressing the curvature blade. So we will call the ensatæ, instead,
  'gladiolæ,' translating, 'scymitar-grasses.' And having <!-- Page 164
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>[164]</span> now got at
  some clear idea of the distinction between outlaid and inlaid growth in
  the stem, the reader will find the elementary analysis of forms resulting
  from outlaid growth in 'Modern Painters'; and I mean to republish it in
  the sequel of this book, but must go on to other matters here. The growth
  of the inlaid stem we will follow as far as we need, for English plants,
  in examining the glasses.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Florence</span>, <i>11th September, 1874</i>.

  <p>As I correct this chapter for press, I find it is too imperfect to be
  let go without a word or two more. In the first place, I have not enough,
  in distinguishing the nature of the living yearly shoot, with its cluster
  of fresh leafage, from that of the accumulated mass of perennial trees,
  taken notice of the similar power even of the annual shoot, to obtain
  some manner of immortality for itself, or at least of usefulness,
  <i>after</i> death. A Tuscan woman stopped me on the path up to Fiesole
  last night, to beg me to buy her plaited straw. I wonder how long straw
  lasts, if one takes care of it? A Leghorn bonnet, (if now such things
  are,) carefully put away,&mdash;even properly taken care of when it is
  worn,&mdash;how long will it last, young ladies?</p>

  <p>I have just been reading the fifth chapter of II. Esdras, and am fain
  to say, with less discomfort than otherwise I might have felt, (the
  example being set me by the archangel Uriel,) "I am not sent to tell
  thee, for I do not know." How old is the oldest straw known? the oldest
  <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>[165]</span>
  linen? the oldest hemp? We have mummy wheat,&mdash;cloth of papyrus,
  which is a kind of straw. The paper reeds by the brooks, the flax-flower
  in the field, leave such imperishable frame behind them. And
  Ponte-della-Paglia, in Venice; and Straw Street, of Paris, remembered in
  Heaven,&mdash;there is no occasion to change their names, as one may have
  to change 'Waterloo Bridge,' or the 'Rue de l'Impératrice.' Poor Empress!
  Had she but known that her true dominion was in the straw streets of her
  fields; not in the stone streets of her cities!</p>

  <p>But think how wonderful this imperishableness of the stem of many
  plants is, even in their annual work: how much more in their perennial
  work! The noble stability between death and life, of a piece of perfect
  wood? It cannot grow, but will not decay; keeps record of its years of
  life, but surrenders them to become a constantly serviceable thing: which
  may be sailed in, on the sea, built with, on the land, carved by
  Donatello, painted on by Fra Angelico. And it is not the wood's fault,
  but the fault of Florence in not taking proper care of it, that the panel
  of Sandro Botticelli's loveliest picture has cracked, (not with heat, I
  believe, but blighting frost), a quarter of an inch wide through the
  Madonna's face.</p>

  <p>But what is this strange state of undecaying wood? What sort of latent
  life has it, which it only finally parts with when it rots?</p>

  <p>Nay, what is the law by which its natural life is measured? What makes
  a tree 'old'? One sees the <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>[166]</span> Spanish-chesnut trunks among the
  Apennines growing into caves, instead of logs. Vast hollows, confused
  among the recessed darknesses of the marble crags, surrounded by mere
  laths of living stem, each with its coronal of glorious green leaves. Why
  can't the tree go on, and on,&mdash;hollowing itself into a
  Fairy&mdash;no&mdash;a Dryad, Ring,&mdash;till it becomes a perfect
  Stonehenge of a tree? Truly, "I am not sent to tell thee, for I do not
  know."</p>

  <p>The worst of it is, however, that I don't know one thing which I ought
  very thoroughly to have known at least thirty years ago, namely, the true
  difference in the way of building the trunk in outlaid and inlaid wood. I
  have an idea that the stem of a palm-tree is only a heap of leaf-roots
  built up like a tower of bricks, year by year, and that the palm tree
  really grows on the top of it, like a bunch of fern; but I've no books
  here, and no time to read them if I had. If only I were a strong giant,
  instead of a thin old gentleman of fifty-five, how I should like to pull
  up one of those little palm-trees by the roots&mdash;(by the way, what
  are the roots of a palm like? and, how does it stand in sand, where it is
  wanted to stand, mostly? Fancy, not knowing that, at
  fifty-five!)&mdash;that grow all along the Riviera; and snap its stem in
  two, and cut it down the middle. But I suppose there are sections enough
  now in our grand botanical collections, and you can find it all out for
  yourself. That you should be able to ask a question clearly, is
  two-thirds of the way to getting it answered; and I think this chapter of
  mine will at <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>[167]</span> least enable you to ask some questions
  about the stem, though what a stem is, truly, "I am not sent to tell
  thee, for I do not know."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Knaresborough</span>, <i>30th April, 1876</i>.

  <p>I see by the date of last paragraph that this chapter has been in my
  good Aylesbury printer's type for more than a year and a half. At this
  rate, Proserpina has a distant chance of being finished in the
  spirit-land, with more accurate information derived from the archangel
  Uriel himself, (not that he is likely to know much about the matter, if
  he keeps on letting himself be prevented from ever seeing foliage in
  spring-time by the black demon-winds,) about the year 2000. In the
  meantime, feeling that perhaps I <i>am</i> sent to tell my readers a
  little more than is above told, I have had recourse to my botanical
  friend, good Mr. Oliver of Kew, who has taught me, first, of palms, that
  they actually stitch themselves into the ground, with a long dipping
  loop, up and down, of the root fibres, concerning which sempstress-work I
  shall have a month's puzzlement before I can report on it; secondly, that
  all the increment of tree stem is, by division and multiplication of the
  cells of the wood, a process not in the least to be described as 'sending
  down roots from the leaf to the ground.' I suspected as much in beginning
  to revise this chapter; but hold to my judgment in not cancelling it. For
  this multiplication of the cells is at least compelled by an influence
  which passes from the leaf to the ground, and vice versa; and which is at
  present best <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>[168]</span> conceivable to me by imagining the
  continual and invisible descent of lightning from electric cloud by a
  conducting rod, endowed with the power of softly splitting the rod into
  two rods, each as thick as the original one. Studying microscopically, we
  should then see the molecules of copper, as we see the cells of the wood,
  dividing and increasing, each one of them into two. But the visible
  result, and mechanical conditions of growth, would still be the same as
  if the leaf actually sent down a new root fibre; and, more than this, the
  currents of accumulating substance, marked by the grain of the wood, are,
  I think, quite plainly and absolutely those of streams flowing only from
  the leaves downwards; never from the root up, nor of mere lateral
  increase. I must look over all my drawings again, and at tree stems
  again, with more separate study of the bark and pith in those museum
  sections, before I can assert this; but there will be no real difficulty
  in the investigation. If the increase of the wood is lateral only, the
  currents round the knots will be compressed at the sides, and open above
  and below; but if downwards, compressed above the knot and open below it.
  The nature of the force itself, and the manner of its ordinances in
  direction, remain, and must for ever remain, inscrutable as our own
  passions, in the hand of the God of all Spirits, and of all Flesh.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE BARK.</p>

  <p>1. Philologists are continually collecting instances, like our friend
  the French critic of Virgil, of the beauty of finished language, or the
  origin of unfinished, in the imitation of natural sounds. But such
  collections give an entirely false idea of the real power of language,
  unless they are balanced by an opponent list of the words which signally
  fail of any such imitative virtue, and whose sound, if one dwelt upon it,
  is destructive of their meaning.</p>

  <p>2. For instance. Few sounds are more distinct in their kind, or one
  would think more likely to be vocally reproduced in the word which
  signified them, than that of a swift rent in strongly woven cloth; and
  the English word 'rag' and ragged, with the Greek <span title="rhêgnumi" class="grk"
  >&#x1FE5;&#x1F75;&gamma;&nu;&upsilon;&mu;&iota;</span>, do indeed in a
  measure recall the tormenting effect upon the ear. But it is curious that
  the verb which is meant to express the actual origination of rags, should
  rhyme with two words entirely musical and peaceful&mdash;words, indeed,
  which I always reserve for final resource in passages which I want to be
  soothing as well as pretty,&mdash;'fair,' and <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>[171]</span> 'air;' while, in its
  orthography, it is identical with the word representing the bodily sign
  of tenderest passion, and grouped with a multitude of others,<a
  name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> in which the mere
  insertion of a consonant makes such wide difference of sentiment as
  between 'dear' and 'drear,' or 'pear' and 'spear.' The Greek root, on the
  other hand, has persisted in retaining some vestige of its excellent
  dissonance, even where it has parted with the last vestige of the idea it
  was meant to convey; and when Burns did his best,&mdash;and his best was
  above most men's&mdash;to gather pleasant liquid and labial syllabling,
  round gentle meaning, in</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Bonnie lassie, will ye go,</p>
      <p>Will ye go, will ye go,</p>
      <p>Bonnie lassie, will ye go,</p>
      <p>To the birks of Aberfeldy?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>he certainly had little thought that the delicately crisp final k, in
  birk, was the remnant of a magnificent Greek effort to express the
  rending of the earth by earthquake, in the wars of the giants. In the
  middle of that word 'esmarag&#x113;se,' we get our own beggar's 'rag' for
  a pure root, which afterwards, through the Latin frango, softens into our
  'break,' and 'bark,'&mdash;the 'broken thing'; that idea of its rending
  around the tree's stem having been, in the very earliest human efforts at
  botanical description, <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>[172]</span> attached to it by the pure Aryan race,
  watching the strips of rosy satin break from the birch stems, in the
  Aberfeldys of Imaus.</p>

  <p>3. That this tree should have been the only one which "the Aryans,
  coming as conquerors from the North, were able to recognize in
  Hindustan,"<a name="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> and should
  therefore also be "the only one whose name is common to Sanskrit, and to
  the languages of Europe," delighted me greatly, for two reasons: the
  first, for its proof that in spite of the development of species, the
  sweet gleaming of birch stem has never changed its argent and sable for
  any unchequered heraldry; and the second, that it gave proof of a much
  more important fact, the keenly accurate observation of Aryan foresters
  at that early date; for the fact is that the breaking of the thin-beaten
  silver of the birch trunk is so delicate, and its smoothness so graceful,
  that until I painted it with care, I was not altogether clear-headed
  myself about the way in which the chequering was done: nor until Fors
  today brought me to the house of one of my father's friends at
  Carshalton, and gave me three birch stems to look at just outside the
  window, did I perceive it to be a primal question about them, what it is
  that blanches that dainty dress of theirs, or, anticipatorily, weaves.
  What difference is there between the making of the corky excrescence of
  other <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>[173]</span> trees, and of this almost transparent
  fine white linen? I perceive that the older it is, within limits, the
  finer and whiter; hoary tissue, instead of hoary hair&mdash;honouring the
  tree's aged body; the outer sprays have no silvery light on their youth.
  Does the membrane thin itself into whiteness merely by stretching, or
  produce an outer film of new substance?<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

  <p>4. And secondly, this investiture, why is it transverse to the
  trunk,&mdash;swathing it, as it were, in bands? Above all,&mdash;when it
  breaks,&mdash;why does it break round the tree instead of down? All other
  bark breaks as anything would, naturally, round a swelling rod, but this,
  as if the stem were growing longer; until, indeed, it reaches farthest
  heroic old age, when the whiteness passes away again, and the rending is
  like that of other trees, downwards. So that, as it were in a changing
  language, we have the great botanical fact twice taught us, by this tree
  of Eden, that the skins of trees differ from the skins of the higher
  animals in that, for the most part, they won't stretch, and must be worn
  torn.</p>

  <p>So that in fact the most popular arrangement of vegetative adult
  costume is Irish; a normal investiture in honourable rags; and
  decorousness of tattering, as of a banner borne in splendid ruin through
  storms of war.</p>

  <p>5. Now therefore, if we think of it, we have five <!-- Page 174
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[174]</span> distinct
  orders of investiture for organic creatures; first, mere secretion of
  mineral substance, chiefly lime, into a hard shell, which, if broken, can
  only be mended, like china&mdash;by sticking it together; secondly,
  organic substance of armour which grows into its proper shape at once for
  good and all, and can't be mended at all, if broken, (as of insects);
  thirdly, organic substance of skin, which stretches, as the creatures
  grows, by cracking, over a fresh skin which is supplied beneath it, as in
  bark of trees; fourthly, organic substance of skin cracked symmetrically
  into plates or scales which can increase all round their edges, and are
  connected by softer skin, below, as in fish and reptiles, (divided with
  exquisite lustre and flexibility, in feathers of birds); and lastly, true
  elastic skin, extended in soft unison with the creature's
  growth,&mdash;blushing with its blood, fading with its fear; breathing
  with its breath, and guarding its life with sentinel beneficence of
  pain.</p>

  <p>6. It is notable, in this higher and lower range of organic beauty,
  that the decoration, by pattern and colour, which is almost universal in
  the protective coverings of the middle ranks of animals, should be
  reserved in vegetables for the most living part of them, the flower only;
  and that among animals, few but the malignant and senseless are
  permitted, in the corrugation of their armour, to resemble the half-dead
  trunk of the tree, as they float beside it in the tropical river. I must,
  however, leave the scale patterns of the palms and other inlaid tropical
  <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>[175]</span>
  stems for after-examination,&mdash;content, at present, with the general
  idea of the bark of an outlaid tree as the successive accumulation of the
  annual protecting film, rent into ravines of slowly increasing depth, and
  coloured, like the rock, whose stability it begins to emulate, with the
  grey or gold of clinging lichen and embroidering moss.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">GENEALOGY.</p>

  <p>1. Returning, after more than a year's sorrowful interval, to my
  Sicilian fields,&mdash;not incognisant, now, of some of the darker realms
  of Proserpina; and with feebler heart, and, it may be, feebler wits, for
  wandering in her brighter ones,&mdash;I find what I had written by way of
  sequel to the last chapter, somewhat difficult, and extremely tiresome.
  Not the less, after giving fair notice of the difficulty, and asking due
  pardon for the tiresomeness, I am minded to let it stand; trusting to
  end, with it, once for all, investigations of the kind. But in finishing
  this first volume of my School Botany, I must try to give the reader some
  notion of the plan of the book, as it now, during the time for thinking
  over it which illness left me, has got itself arranged in my mind, within
  limits of possible execution. And this the rather, because I wish also to
  state, somewhat more gravely than I have yet done, the grounds on which I
  venture here to reject many of the received names of plants; and to
  substitute others for them, relating to entirely different attributes
  <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>[177]</span>
  from those on which their present nomenclature is confusedly edified.</p>

  <p>I have already in some measure given the reasons for this change;<a
  name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> but I feel that, for the
  sake of those among my scholars who have laboriously learned the accepted
  names, I ought now also to explain its method more completely.</p>

  <p>2. I call the present system of nomenclature <i>confusedly</i>
  edified, because it introduces,&mdash;without, apparently, any
  consciousness of the inconsistency, and certainly with no apology for
  it,&mdash;names founded sometimes on the history of plants, sometimes on
  their qualities, sometimes on their forms, sometimes on their products,
  and sometimes on their poetical associations.</p>

  <p>On their history&mdash;as 'Gentian' from King Gentius, and Funkia from
  Dr. Funk.</p>

  <p>On their qualities&mdash;as 'Scrophularia' from its (quite
  uncertified) use in scrofula.</p>

  <p>On their forms&mdash;as the 'Caryophylls' from having petals like
  husks of nuts.</p>

  <p>On their products&mdash;as 'Cocos nucifera' from its nuts.</p>

  <p>And on their poetical associations,&mdash;as the Star of Bethlehem
  from its imagined resemblance to the light of that seen by the Magi.</p>

  <p>3. Now, this variety of grounds for nomenclature might patiently, and
  even with advantage, be permitted, <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>[178]</span> provided the grounds
  themselves were separately firm, and the inconsistency of method
  advisedly allowed, and, in each case, justified. If the histories of King
  Gentius and Dr. Funk are indeed important branches of human
  knowledge;&mdash;if the Scrophulariaceæ do indeed cure King's
  Evil;&mdash;if pinks be best described in their likeness to
  nuts;&mdash;and the Star of Bethlehem verily remind us of Christ's
  Nativity,&mdash;by all means let these and other such names be evermore
  retained. But if Dr. Funk be not a person in any special manner needing
  either stellification or florification; if neither herb nor flower can
  avail, more than the touch of monarchs, against hereditary pain; if it be
  no better account of a pink to say it is nut-leaved, than of a nut to say
  it is pink-leaved; and if the modern mind, incurious respecting the
  journeys of wise men, has already confused, in its Bradshaw's Bible, the
  station of Bethlehem with that of Bethel,<a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> it is certainly time to take some order
  with the partly false, partly useless, and partly forgotten literature of
  the Fields; and, before we bow our children's memories to the burden of
  it, ensure that there shall be matter worth carriage in the load.</p>

  <p>4. And farther, in attempting such a change, we must be clear in our
  own minds whether we wish our nomenclature to tell us something about the
  plant itself, or only to tell us the place it holds in relation to other
  plants: as, for instance, in the Herb-Robert, would it be well to <!--
  Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>[179]</span>
  christen it, shortly, 'Rob Roy,' because it is pre-eminently red, and so
  have done with it;&mdash;or rather to dwell on its family connections,
  and call it 'Macgregoraceous'?</p>

  <p>5. Before we can wisely decide this point, we must resolve whether our
  botany is intended mainly to be useful to the vulgar, or satisfactory to
  the scientific élite. For if we give names characterizing individuals,
  the circle of plants which any country possesses may be easily made known
  to the children who live in it: but if we give names founded on the
  connexion between these and others at the Antipodes, the parish
  school-master will certainly have double work; and it may be doubted
  greatly whether the parish school-boy, at the end of the lecture, will
  have half as many ideas.</p>

  <p>6. Nevertheless, when the features of any great order of plants are
  constant, and, on the whole, represented with great clearness both in
  cold and warm climates, it may be desirable to express this their
  citizenship of the world in definite nomenclature. But my own method, so
  far as hitherto developed, consists essentially in fastening the thoughts
  of the pupil on the special character of the plant, in the place where he
  is likely to see it; and therefore, in expressing the power of its race
  and order in the wider world, rather by reference to mythological
  associations than to botanical structure.</p>

  <p>7. For instance, Plate VII. represents, of its real size, an ordinary
  spring flower in our English mountain fields. It is an average
  example,&mdash;not one of rare size under rare <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>[180]</span>
  conditions,&mdash;rather smaller than the average, indeed, that I might
  get it well into my plate. It is one of the flowers whose names I think
  good to change; but I look carefully through the existing titles
  belonging to it and its fellows, that I may keep all I expediently can. I
  find, in the first place, that Linnæus called one group of its relations,
  Ophryds, from Ophrys,&mdash;Greek for the eyebrow,&mdash;on account of
  their resemblance to the brow of an animal frowning, or to the
  overshadowing casque of a helmet. I perceive this to be really a very
  general aspect of the flower; and therefore, no less than in respect to
  Linnæus, I adopt this for the total name of the order, and call them
  'Ophrydæ,' or, shortly, 'Ophryds.'</p>

  <p>8. Secondly: so far as I know these flowers myself, I perceive them to
  fall practically into three divisions,&mdash;one, growing in English
  meadows and Alpine pastures, and always adding to their beauty; another,
  growing in all sorts of places, very ugly itself, and adding to the
  ugliness of its indiscriminated haunts; and a third, growing mostly up in
  the air, with as little root as possible, and of gracefully fantastic
  forms, such as this kind of nativity and habitation might presuppose. For
  the present, I am satisfied to give names to these three groups only.
  There may be plenty of others which I do not know, and which other people
  may name, according to their knowledge. But in all these three kinds
  known to me, I perceive one constant characteristic to be <i>some</i>
  manner of <i>distortion</i> and I desire that fact,&mdash;marking a <!--
  Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>
  spiritual (in my sense of the word) character of extreme
  mystery,&mdash;to be the first enforced on the mind of the young learner.
  It is exhibited to the English child, primarily, in the form of the stalk
  of each flower, attaching it to the central virga. This stalk is always
  twisted once and a half round, as if somebody had been trying to wring
  the blossom off; and the name of the family, in Proserpina, will
  therefore be 'Contorta'<a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
  in Latin, and 'Wreathe-wort' in English.</p>

  <p>Farther: the beautiful power of the one I have drawn in its spring
  life, is in the opposition of its dark purple to the primrose in England,
  and the pale yellow anemone in the Alps. And its individual name will be,
  therefore, 'Contorta purpurea'&mdash;<i>Purple</i> Wreathe-wort.</p>

  <p>And in drawing it, I take care to dwell on this strength of its color,
  and to show thoroughly that it is a <i>dark</i> blossom,<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> before I trouble myself about its minor
  characters.</p>

  <p>9. The second group of this kind of flowers live, as I said, in all
  sorts of places; but mostly, I think, in disagreeable ones,&mdash;torn
  and irregular ground, under alternations of unwholesome heat and shade,
  and among swarms of nasty insects. I cannot yet venture on any bold
  general statement about them, but I think that is mostly their way; and
  at all events, they themselves are in the <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>[182]</span> habit of dressing in
  livid and unpleasant colors; and are distinguished from all other flowers
  by twisting, not only their stalks, but one of their petals, not once and
  a half only, but two or three times round, and putting it far out at the
  same time, as a foul jester would put out his tongue: while also the
  singular power of grotesque mimicry, which, though strong also in the
  other groups of their race, seems in the others more or less playful, is,
  in these, definitely degraded, and, in aspect, malicious.</p>

  <p>10. Now I find the Latin name 'Satyrium' attached already to one sort
  of these flowers; and we cannot possibly have a better one for all of
  them. It is true that, in its first Greek form, Dioscorides attaches it
  to a white, not a livid, flower; and I dare say there are some white ones
  of the breed: but, in its full sense, the term is exactly right for the
  entire group of ugly blossoms of which the characteristic is the spiral
  curve and protraction of their central petal: and every other form of
  Satyric ugliness which I find among the Ophryds, whatever its color, will
  be grouped with them. And I make them central, because this humour runs
  through the whole order, and is, indeed, their distinguishing sign.</p>

  <p>11. Then the third group, living actually in the air, and only holding
  fast by, without nourishing itself from, the ground, rock, or tree-trunk
  on which it is rooted, may of course most naturally and accurately be
  called 'Aeria,' as it has long been popularly known in English by the
  name of Air-plant. <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[183]</span></p>

  <p>Thus we have one general name for all these creatures, 'Ophryd'; and
  three family or group names, Contorta, Satyrium, and Aeria,&mdash;every
  one of these titles containing as much accurate fact about the thing
  named as I can possibly get packed into their syllables: and I will
  trouble my young readers with no more divisions of the order. And if
  their parents, tutors, or governors, after this fair warning, choose to
  make them learn, instead, the seventy-seven different names with which
  botanist-heraldries have beautifully ennobled the family,&mdash;all I can
  say is, let them at least begin by learning them themselves. They will be
  found in due order in pages 1084, 1085 of Loudon's Cyclopædia.<a
  name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

  <p>12. But now, farther: the student will observe that the name of the
  total order is Greek; while the three family ones are Latin, although the
  central one is originally Greek also.</p>

  <p>I adopt this as far as possible for a law through my whole plant
  nomenclature.</p>

  <p>13. Farther: the terminations of the Latin family names will be, for
  the most part, of the masculine, <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[184]</span> feminine, and neuter
  forms, us, a, um, with these following attached conditions.</p>

  <p>(<span class="scac">I.</span>) Those terminating in 'us,' though often
  of feminine words, as the central Arbor, will indicate either real
  masculine strength (quereus, laurus), or conditions of dominant majesty
  (cedrus), of stubbornness and enduring force (crataegus), or of
  peasant-like commonalty and hardship (juncus); softened, as it may
  sometimes happen, into gentleness and beneficence (thymus). The
  occasional forms in 'er' and 'il' will have similar power (acer,
  basil).</p>

  <p>(<span class="scac">II.</span>) Names with the feminine termination
  'a,' if they are real names of girls, will always mean flowers that are
  perfectly pretty and perfectly good (Lucia, Viola, Margarita, Clarissa).
  Names terminating in 'a' which are not also accepted names of girls, may
  sometimes be none the less honourable, (Primula, Campanula,) but for the
  most part will signify either plants that are only good and worthy in a
  nursy sort of way, (Salvia,) or that are good without being pretty,
  (Lavandula,) or pretty without being good, (Kalmia). But no name
  terminating in 'a' will be attached to a plant that is neither good nor
  pretty.</p>

  <p>(<span class="scac">III.</span>) The neuter names terminating in 'um'
  will always indicate some power either of active or suggestive evil,
  (Conîum, Solanum, Satyrium,) or a relation, more or less definite, to
  death; but this relation to death may sometimes be noble, or
  pathetic,&mdash;"which <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185"></a>[185]</span> to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the
  oven,"&mdash;Lilium.</p>

  <p>But the leading position of these neuters in the plant's double name
  must be noticed by students unacquainted with Latin, in order to
  distinguish them from plural genitives, which will always, of course, be
  the second word, (Francesca Fontium, Francesca of the Springs.)</p>

  <p>14. Names terminating in 'is' and 'e,' if definitely names of women,
  (Iris, Amaryllis, Alcestis, Daphne,) will always signify flowers of great
  beauty, and noble historic association. If not definitely names of women,
  they will yet indicate some specialty of sensitiveness, or association
  with legend (Berberis, Clematis). No neuters in 'e' will be admitted.</p>

  <p>15. Participial terminations (Impatiens), with neuters in 'en'
  (Cyclamen), will always be descriptive of some special quality or
  form,&mdash;leaving it indeterminate if good or bad, until explained. It
  will be manifestly impossible to limit either these neuters, or the
  feminines in 'is' to Latin forms; but we shall always know by their
  termination that they cannot be generic names, if we are strict in
  forming these last on a given method.</p>

  <p>16. How little method there is in our present formation of them, I am
  myself more and more surprised as I consider. A child is shown a rose,
  and told that he is to call every flower like that, 'Rosaceous';<a
  name="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> he is next <!-- Page 186
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>[186]</span> shown a lily,
  and told that he is to call every flower like that,
  'Liliaceous';&mdash;so far well; but he is next shown a daisy, and is not
  at all allowed to call every flower like that, 'Daisaceous,' but he must
  call it, like the fifth order of architecture, 'Composite'; and being
  next shown a pink, he is not allowed to call other pinks 'Pinkaceous,'
  but 'Nut-leafed'; and being next shown a pease-blossom, he is not allowed
  to call other pease-blossoms 'Peasaceous,' but, in a brilliant burst of
  botanical imagination, he is incited to call it by two names instead of
  one, 'Butterfly-aceous' from its flower, and 'Pod-aceous' from its
  seed;&mdash;the inconsistency of the terms thus enforced upon him being
  perfected in their inaccuracy, for a daisy is not one whit more composite
  than Queen of the meadow, or Jura Jacinth;<a name="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> and 'legumen' is not Latin for a pod,
  but 'siliqua,'&mdash;so that no good scholar could remember Virgil's
  'siliqua quassante legumen,' without overthrowing all his Pisan
  nomenclature.</p>

  <p>17. Farther. If we ground our names of the higher orders on the
  distinctive characters of <i>form</i> in plants, these are so many, and
  so subtle, that we are at once involved in more investigations than a
  young learner has ever time to follow successfully, and they must be at
  all times liable to dislocations and rearrangements on the discovery of
  any new link in the infinitely entangled <!-- Page 187 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span> chain. But if we found
  our higher nomenclature at once on historic fact, and relative conditions
  of climate and character, rather than of form, we may at once distribute
  our flora into unalterable groups, to which we may add at our pleasure,
  but which will never need disturbance; far less, reconstruction.</p>

  <p>18. For instance,&mdash;and to begin,&mdash;it is an historical fact
  that for many centuries the English nation believed that the Founder of
  its religion, spiritually, by the mouth of the King who spake of all
  herbs, had likened himself to two flowers,&mdash;the Rose of Sharon, and
  Lily of the Valley. The fact of this belief is one of the most important
  in the history of England,&mdash;that is to say, of the mind or heart of
  England: and it is connected solemnly with the heart of Italy also, by
  the closing cantos of the Paradiso.</p>

  <p>I think it well therefore that our two first generic, or at least
  commandant, names heading the out-laid and in-laid divisions of plants,
  should be of the rose and lily, with such meaning in them as may remind
  us of this fact in the history of human mind.</p>

  <p>It is also historical that the personal appearing of this Master of
  our religion was spoken of by our chief religious teacher in these terms:
  "The Grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men."
  And it is a constant fact that this 'grace' or 'favor' of God is spoken
  of as "giving us to eat of the Tree of Life."</p>

  <p>19. Now, comparing the botanical facts I have to express, with these
  historical ones, I find that the rose tribe <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>[188]</span> has been formed among
  flowers, not in distant and monstrous geologic æras, but in the human
  epoch;&mdash;that its 'grace' or favor has been in all countries so felt
  as to cause its acceptance everywhere for the most perfect physical type
  of womanhood;&mdash;and that the characteristic fruit of the tribe is so
  sweet, that it has become symbolic at once of the subtlest temptation,
  and the kindest ministry to the earthly passion of the human race.
  "Comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love."</p>

  <p>20. Therefore I shall call the entire order of these flowers
  'Charites,' (Graces,) and they will be divided into these five genera,
  Rosa, Persica, Pomum, Rubra, and Fragaria. Which sequence of names I do
  not think the young learner will have difficulty in remembering; nor in
  understanding why I distinguish the central group by the fruit instead of
  the flower. And if he once clearly master the structure and relations of
  these five genera, he will have no difficulty in attaching to them, in a
  satellitic or subordinate manner, such inferior groups as that of the
  Silver-weed, or the Tormentilla; but all he will have to learn by heart
  and rote, will be these six names; the Greek Master-name, Charites, and
  the five generic names, in each case belonging to plants, as he will soon
  find, of extreme personal interest to him.</p>

  <p>21. I have used the word 'Order' as the name of our widest groups, in
  preference to 'Class,' because these widest groups will not always
  include flowers like each other in form, or equal to each other in
  vegetative rank; <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>[189]</span> but they will be 'Orders,' literally like
  those of any religious or chivalric association, having some common link
  rather intellectual than national,&mdash;the Charites, for instance,
  linked by their kindness,&mdash;the Oreiades, by their mountain
  seclusion, as Sisters of Charity or Monks of the Chartreuse, irrespective
  of ties of relationship. Then beneath these orders will come, what may be
  rightly called, either as above in Greek derivation, 'Genera,' or in
  Latin, 'Gentes,' for which, however, I choose the Latin word, because
  Genus is disagreeably liable to be confused on the ear with 'genius'; but
  Gens, never; and also 'nomen gentile' is a clearer and better expression
  than 'nomen generosum,' and I will not coin the barbarous one,
  'genericum.' The name of the Gens, (as 'Lucia,') with an attached
  epithet, as 'Verna,' will, in most cases, be enough to characterize the
  individual flower; but if farther subdivision be necessary, the third
  order will be that of Families, indicated by a 'nomen familiare' added in
  the third place of nomenclature, as Lucia Verna,&mdash;Borealis; and no
  farther subdivision will ever be admitted. I avoid the word
  'species'&mdash;originally a bad one, and lately vulgarized beyond
  endurance&mdash;altogether. And varieties belonging to narrow localities,
  or induced by horticulture, may be named as they please by the people
  living near the spot, or by the gardener who grows them; but will not be
  acknowledged by Proserpina. Nevertheless, the arbitrary reduction under
  Ordines, Gentes, and Familiæ, <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>[190]</span> is always to be remembered as one of
  massive practical convenience only; and the more subtle arborescence of
  the infinitely varying structures may be followed, like a human
  genealogy, as far as we please, afterwards; when once we have got our
  common plants clearly arranged and intelligibly named.</p>

  <p>22. But now we find ourselves in the presence of a new difficulty, the
  greatest we have to deal with in the whole matter.</p>

  <p>One new nomenclature, to be thoroughly good, must be acceptable to
  scholars in the five great languages, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and
  English; and it must be acceptable by them in teaching the native
  children of each country. I shall not be satisfied, unless I can feel
  that the little maids who gather their first violets under the Acropolis
  rock, may receive for them Æschylean words again with joy. I shall not be
  content, unless the mothers watching their children at play in the
  Ceramicus of Paris, under the scarred ruins of her Kings' palace, may yet
  teach them there to know the flowers which the Maid of Orleans gathered
  at Domremy. I shall not be satisfied unless every word I ask from the
  lips of the children of Florence and Rome, may enable them better to
  praise the flowers that are chosen by the hand of Matilda,<a
  name="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> and bloom around the tomb
  of Virgil.</p>

<p><!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>[191]</span></p>

  <p>23. Now in this first example of nomenclature, the Master-name, being
  <i>pure</i> Greek, may easily be accepted by Greek children, remembering
  that certain also of their own poets, if they did not call the flower a
  Grace itself, at least thought of it as giving gladness to the Three in
  their dances.<a name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> But for
  French children the word 'Grâce' has been doubly and trebly corrupted;
  first, by entirely false theological scholarship, mistaking the 'Favor'
  or Grace done by God to good men, for the 'Misericordia,' or mercy, shown
  by Him to bad ones; and so, in practical life, finally substituting
  'Grâce' as a word of extreme and mortal prayer, for 'Merci,' and of late
  using 'Merci' in a totally ridiculous and perverted power, for the giving
  of thanks (or refusal of offered good): while the literally derived word
  'Charite' has become, in the modern mind, a gift, whether from God or
  man, only to the wretched, never to the happy: and lastly, 'Grâce' in its
  physical sense has been perverted, by their social vulgarity, into an
  idea, whether with respect to form or motion, commending itself rather to
  the ballet-master than either to the painter or the priest.</p>

  <p>For these reasons, the Master name of this family, for my French
  pupils, must be simply 'Rhodiades,' which will bring, for them, the
  entire group of names into easily remembered symmetry; and the English
  form of <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>[192]</span> the same name, Rhodiad, is to be used by
  English scholars also for all tribes of this group except the five
  principal ones.</p>

  <p>24. Farther, in every gens of plants, one will be chosen as the
  representative, which, if any, will be that examined and described in the
  course of this work, if I have opportunity of doing so.</p>

  <p>This representative flower will always be a wild one, and of the
  simplest form which completely expresses the character of the plant;
  existing divinely and unchangeably from age to age, ungrieved by man's
  neglect, and inflexible by his power.</p>

  <p>And this divine character will be expressed by the epithet 'Sacred,'
  taking the sense in which we attach it to a dominant and christened
  majesty, when it belongs to the central type of any forceful
  order;&mdash;'Quercus sacra,' 'Laurus sacra,' etc.,&mdash;the word
  'Benedicta,' or 'Benedictus,' being used instead, if the plant be too
  humble to bear, without some discrepancy and unbecomingness, the higher
  title; as 'Carduus Benedictus,' Holy Thistle.</p>

  <p>25. Among the gentes of flowers bearing girls' names, the dominant one
  will be simply called the Queen, 'Rose Regina,' 'Rose the Queen' (the
  English wild rose); 'Clarissa Regina,' 'Clarissa the Queen' (Mountain
  Pink); 'Lucia Regina,' 'Lucy the Queen' (Spring Gentian), or in simpler
  English, 'Lucy of Teesdale,' as 'Harry of Monmouth.' The ruling flowers
  of groups <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>[193]</span> which bear names not yet accepted for
  names of girls, will be called simply 'Domina,' or shortly 'Donna.'
  'Rubra domina' (wild raspberry): the wild strawberry, because of her use
  in heraldry, will bear a name of her own, exceptional, 'Cora
  coronalis.'</p>

  <p>26. These main points being understood, and concessions made, we may
  first arrange the greater orders of land plants in a group of twelve,
  easily remembered, and with very little forcing. There must be
  <i>some</i> forcing always to get things into quite easily tenable form,
  for Nature always has her ins and outs. But it is curious how fitly and
  frequently the number of twelve may be used for memoria technica; and in
  this instance the Greek derivative names fall at once into harmony with
  the most beautiful parts of Greek mythology, leading on to early
  Christian tradition.</p>

  <p>27. Their series will be, therefore, as follows: the principal
  subordinate groups being at once placed under each of the great ones. The
  reasons for occasional appearance of inconsistency will be afterwards
  explained, and the English and French forms given in each case are the
  terms which would be used in answering the rapid question, 'Of what order
  is this flower?' the answer being, It is a 'Cyllenid,' a 'Pleiad,' or a
  'Vestal,' as one would answer of a person, he is a Knight of St. John or
  Monk of St. Benedict; while to the question, of what gens, we answer, a
  Stella or an Erica, as one would answer of a person, a Stuart or
  Plantagenet. <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>I will shortly note the changes of name in their twelve orders, and
  the reasons for them.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">I.</span> <span
  class="sc">Charites</span>.&mdash;The only change made in the
  nomenclature of this order is the slight one of 'rubra' for 'rubus':
  partly to express true sisterhood with the other Charites; partly to
  enforce the idea of redness, as characteristic of the race, both in the
  lovely purple and russet of their winter leafage, and in the exquisite
  bloom of scarlet on the stems in strong young shoots. They have every
  right to be placed among the Charites, first because the raspberry is
  really a more important fruit in domestic economy than the strawberry;
  and, secondly, because the wild bramble is often in its wandering sprays
  even more graceful than the rose; and in blossom and <!-- Page 196
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>[196]</span> fruit the
  best autumnal gift that English Nature has appointed for her village
  children.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">II.</span> <span
  class="sc">Uranides</span>.&mdash;Not merely because they are all of the
  color of the sky, but also sacred to Urania in their divine purity.
  'Convoluta' instead of 'convolvulus,' chiefly for the sake of euphony;
  but also because pervinca is to be included in this group.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">III.</span> <span
  class="sc">Cyllenides</span>.&mdash;Named from Mount Cyllene in Arcadia,
  because the three races included in the order alike delight in rocky
  ground, and in the cold or moist air of mountain-clouds.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">IV.</span> <span
  class="sc">Oreiades</span>.&mdash;Described in next chapter.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">V.</span> <span
  class="sc">Pleiades</span>.&mdash;From the habit of the flowers belonging
  to this order to get into bright local clusters. Silvia, for the
  wood-sorrel, will I hope be an acceptable change to my girl-readers.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">VI.</span> <span
  class="sc">Artemides</span>.&mdash;Dedicate to Artemis for their
  expression of energy, no less than purity. This character was rightly
  felt in them by whoever gave the name 'Dianthus' to their leading race; a
  name which I should have retained if it had not been bad Greek. I wish
  them, by their name 'Clarissa' to recall the memory of St. Clare, as
  'Francesca' that of St. Francis.<a name="NtA_56"
  href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> The <!-- Page 197 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span> 'issa,' not without
  honour to the greatest of our English moral story-tellers, is added for
  the practical reason, that I think the sound will fasten in the minds of
  children the essential characteristic of the race, the cutting of the
  outer edge of the petal as if with scissors.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">VII.</span> <span
  class="sc">Vestales</span>.&mdash;I allow this Latin form, because
  Hestiades would have been confused with Heliades. The order is named 'of
  the hearth,' from its manifold domestic use, and modest blossoming.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">VIII.</span> <span
  class="sc">Cytherides</span>.&mdash;Dedicate to Venus, but in all purity
  and peace of thought. Giulietta, for the coarse, and more than ordinarily
  false, Polygala.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">IX.</span> <span
  class="sc">Heliades</span>.&mdash;The sun-flowers.<a name="NtA_57"
  href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> In English, Alcestid, in honour to
  Chaucer and the Daisy.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">X.</span> <span
  class="sc">Delphides</span>.&mdash;Sacred to Apollo. Granata, changed
  from Punica, in honor to Granada and the Moors.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">XI.</span> <span
  class="sc">Hesperides</span>.&mdash;Already a name given to the order.
  <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>[198]</span>
  Aegle, prettier and more classic than Limonia, includes the idea of
  brightness in the blossom.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">XII.</span> <span
  class="sc">Athenaides</span>.&mdash;I take Fraxinus into this group,
  because the mountain ash, in its hawthorn-scented flower, scarletest of
  berries, and exquisitely formed and finished leafage, belongs wholly to
  the floral decoration of our native rocks, and is associated with their
  human interests, though lightly, not less spiritually, than the olive
  with the mind of Greece.</p>

  <p>28. The remaining groups are in great part natural; but I separate for
  subsequent study five orders of supreme domestic utility, the Mallows,
  Currants, Pease,<a name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
  Cresses, and Cranesbills, from those which, either in fruit or blossom,
  are for finer pleasure or higher beauty. I think it will be generally
  interesting for children to learn those five names as an easy lesson, and
  gradually discover, wondering, the world that they include. I will give
  their terminology at length, separately.</p>

  <p>29. One cannot, in all groups, have all the divisions of equal
  importance; the Mallows are only placed with the other four for their
  great value in decoration of cottage gardens in autumn: and their softly
  healing <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>[199]</span> qualities as a tribe. They will mentally
  connect the whole useful group with the three great Æsculapiadæ,
  Cinchona, Coffea, and Camellia.</p>

  <p>30. Taking next the water-plants, crowned in the DROSIDÆ, which
  include the five great families, Juncus, Jacinthus, Amaryllis, Iris, and
  Lilium, and are masculine in their Greek name because their two first
  groups, Juncus and Jacinthus, are masculine, I gather together the three
  orders of TRITONIDES, which are notably trefoil; the NAIADES, notably
  quatrefoil, but for which I keep their present pretty name; and the
  BATRACHIDES,<a name="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> notably
  cinqfoil, for which I keep their present ugly one, only changing it from
  Latin into Greek.</p>

  <p>31. I am not sure of being forgiven so readily for putting the
  Grasses, Sedges, Mosses, and Lichens together, under the great general
  head of Demetridæ. But it seems to me the mosses and lichens belong no
  less definitely to Demeter, in being the first gatherers of earth on
  rock, and the first coverers of its sterile surface, than the grass which
  at last prepares it to the foot and to the food of man. And with the
  mosses I shall take all the especially moss-plants which otherwise are
  homeless or companionless, Drosera, and the like, and as a connecting
  link with the flowers belonging to the Dark <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>[200]</span> Kora, the two strange
  orders of the Ophryds and Agarics.</p>

  <p>32. Lastly will come the orders of flowers which may be thought of as
  belonging for the most part to the Dark Kora of the lower
  world,&mdash;having at least the power of death, if not its terror, given
  them, together with offices of comfort and healing in sleep, or of
  strengthening, if not too prolonged, action on the nervous power of life.
  Of these, the first will be the DIONYSIDÆ,&mdash;Hedera, Vitis, Liana;
  then the DRACONIDÆ,&mdash;Atropa, Digitalis, Linaria; and, lastly, the
  MOIRIDÆ,&mdash;Conîum, Papaver, Solanum, Arum, and Nerium.</p>

  <p>33. As I see this scheme now drawn out, simple as it is, the scope of
  it seems not only far too great for adequate completion by my own labour,
  but larger than the time likely to be given to botany by average scholars
  would enable them intelligently to grasp: and yet it includes, I suppose,
  not the tenth part of the varieties of plants respecting which, in
  competitive examination, a student of physical science is now expected to
  know, or at least assert on hearsay, <i>something</i>.</p>

  <p>So far as I have influence with the young, myself, I would pray them
  to be assured that it is better to know the habits of one plant than the
  names of a thousand; and wiser to be happily familiar with those that
  grow in the nearest field, than arduously cognisant of all that plume the
  isles of the Pacific, or illumine the Mountains of the Moon. <!-- Page
  201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[201]</span></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I believe that when once the general form of this system
  in Proserpina has been well learned, much other knowledge may be easily
  attached to it, or sheltered under the eaves of it: and in its own
  development, I believe everything may be included that the student will
  find useful, or may wisely desire to investigate, of properly European
  botany. But I am convinced that the best results of his study will be
  reached by a resolved adherence to extreme simplicity of primal idea, and
  primal nomenclature.</p>

  <p>34. I do not think the need of revisal of our present scientific
  classification could be more clearly demonstrated than by the fact that
  laurels and roses are confused, even by Dr. Lindley, in the mind of his
  feminine readers; the English word laurel, in the index to his first
  volume of Ladies' Botany, referring them to the cherries, under which the
  common laurel is placed as 'Prunus Laurocerasus,' while the true laurel,
  'Laurus nobilis,' must be found in the index of the second volume, under
  the Latin form 'Laurus.'</p>

  <p>This accident, however, illustrates another, and a most important
  point to be remembered, in all arrangements whether of plants, minerals,
  or animals. No single classification can possibly be perfect, or anything
  <i>like</i> perfect. It must be, at its best, a ground, or <i>warp</i> of
  arrangement only, through which, or over which, the cross threads of
  another,&mdash;yes, and of many others,&mdash;must be woven in our minds.
  Thus the almond, though in <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>[202]</span> the form and colour of its flower, and
  method of its fruit, rightly associated with the roses, yet by the
  richness and sweetness of its kernel must be held mentally connected with
  all plants that bear nuts. These assuredly must have something in their
  structure common, justifying their being gathered into a conceived or
  conceivable group of 'Nuciferæ,' in which the almond, hazel, walnut,
  cocoa-nut, and such others would be considered as having relationship, at
  least in their power of secreting a crisp and sweet substance which is
  not wood, nor bark, nor pulp, nor seed-pabulum reducible to softness by
  boiling;&mdash;but quite separate substance, for which I do not know that
  there at present exists any botanical name,&mdash;of which, hitherto, I
  find no general account, and can only myself give so much, on reflection,
  as that it is crisp and close in texture, and always contains some kind
  of oil or milk.</p>

  <p>35. Again, suppose the arrangement of plants could, with respect to
  their flowers and fruits, be made approximately complete, they must
  instantly be broken and reformed by comparison of their stems and leaves.
  The three <i>creeping</i> families of the Charites,&mdash;Rosa, Rubra,
  and Fragaria,&mdash;must then be frankly separated from the elastic
  Persica and knotty Pomum; of which one wild and lovely species, the
  hawthorn, is no less notable for the massive accumulation of wood in the
  stubborn stem of it, than the wild rose for her lovely power of wreathing
  her garlands at pleasure wherever they are <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[203]</span> fairest, the stem
  following them and sustaining, where they will.</p>

  <p>36. Thus, as we examine successively each part of any plant, new
  sisterhoods, and unthought-of fellowships, will be found between the most
  distant orders; and ravines of unexpected separation open between those
  otherwise closely allied. Few botanical characters are more definite than
  the leaf structure illustrated in Plate VI., which has given to one group
  of the Drosidæ the descriptive name of Ensatæ, (see above, Chapter IX.,
  <a href="#c9p11">§ 11</a>,) but this conformation would not be wisely
  permitted to interfere in the least with the arrangement founded on the
  much more decisive floral aspects of the Iris and Lily. So, in the fifth
  volume of 'Modern Painters,' the sword-like, or rather rapier-like,
  leaves of the pine are opposed, for the sake of more vivid realization,
  to the shield-like leaves of the greater number of inland trees; but it
  would be absurd to allow this difference any share in botanical
  arrangement,&mdash;else we should find ourselves thrown into sudden
  discomfiture by the wide-waving and opening foliage of the palms and
  ferns.</p>

  <p>37. But through all the defeats by which insolent endeavors to sum the
  orders of Creation must be reproved, and in the midst of the successes by
  which patient insight will be surprised, the fact of the
  <i>confirmation</i> of species in plants and animals must remain always a
  miraculous one. What outstretched sign of constant Omnipotence can be
  more awful, than that the susceptibility to <!-- Page 204 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span> external influences,
  with the reciprocal power of transformation, in the organs of the plant;
  and the infinite powers of moral training and mental conception over the
  nativity of animals, should be so restrained within impassable limits,
  and by inconceivable laws, that from generation to generation, under all
  the clouds and revolutions of heaven with its stars, and among all the
  calamities and convulsions of the Earth with her passions, the numbers
  and the names of her Kindred may still be counted for her in unfailing
  truth;&mdash;still the fifth sweet leaf unfold for the Rose, and the
  sixth spring for the Lily; and yet the wolf rave tameless round the folds
  of the pastoral mountains, and yet the tiger flame through the forests of
  the night.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">CORA AND KRONOS.</p>

  <p>1. Of all the lovely wild plants&mdash;and few, mountain-bred, in
  Britain, are other than lovely,&mdash;that fill the clefts and crest the
  ridges of my Brantwood rock, the dearest to me, by far, are the clusters
  of whortleberry which divide possession of the lower slopes with the wood
  hyacinth and pervenche. They are personally and specially dear to me for
  their association in my mind with the woods of Montanvert; but the plant
  itself, irrespective of all accidental feeling, is indeed so beautiful in
  all its ways&mdash;so delicately strong in the spring of its leafage, so
  modestly wonderful in the formation of its fruit, and so pure in choice
  of its haunts, not capriciously or unfamiliarly, but growing in
  luxuriance through all the healthiest and sweetest seclusion of mountain
  territory throughout Europe,&mdash;that I think I may without any sharp
  remonstrance be permitted to express for this once only, personal feeling
  in my nomenclature, calling it in Latin 'Myrtilla Cara,' and in French
  'Myrtille Chérie,' but retaining for it in English its simply classic
  name, 'Blue Whortle.' <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>[206]</span></p>

  <p>2. It is the most common representative of the group of Myrtillæ,
  which, on reference to our classification, will be found central between
  the Ericæ and Auroræ. The distinctions between these three families may
  be easily remembered, and had better be learned before going farther; but
  first let us note their fellowship. They are all Oreiades, mountain
  plants; in specialty, they are all strong in stem, low in stature, and
  the Ericæ and Auroræ glorious in the flush of their infinitely exulting
  flowers, ("the rapture of the heath"&mdash;above spoken of, p. 96.) But
  all the essential loveliness of the Myrtillæ is in their leaves and
  fruit: the first always exquisitely finished and grouped like the most
  precious decorative work of sacred painting; the second, red or purple,
  like beads of coral or amethyst. Their minute flowers have rarely any
  general part or power in the colors of mountain ground; but, examined
  closely, they are one of the chief joys of the traveller's rest among the
  Alps; and full of exquisiteness unspeakable, in their several bearings
  and miens of blossom, so to speak. Plate VIII. represents, however
  feebly, the proud bending back of her head by Myrtilla Regina:<a
  name="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> an action as beautiful in
  <i>her</i> as it is terrible in the Kingly Serpent of Egypt.</p>

  <p>3. The formal differences between these three families are trenchant
  and easily remembered. The Ericæ <!-- Page 207 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>[207]</span> are all quatrefoils,
  and quatrefoils of the most studied and accomplished symmetry; and they
  bear no berries, but only dry seeds. The Myrtillæ and Auroræ are both
  Cinqfoil; but the Myrtillæ are symmetrical in their blossom, and the
  Auroræ unsymmetrical. Farther, the Myrtillæ are not absolutely
  determinate in the number of their foils, (this being essentially a
  characteristic of flowers exposed to much hardship,) and are thus
  sometimes quatrefoil, in sympathy with the Ericæ. But the Auroræ are
  strictly cinqfoil. These last are the only European form of a larger
  group, well named 'Azalea' from the Greek <span title="aza" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&zeta;&alpha;</span>, dryness, and its adjective <span
  title="azalea" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&zeta;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F73;&alpha;</span>, dry or parched; and
  <i>this</i> name must be kept for the world-wide group, (including under
  it Rhododendron, but not Kalmia,) because there is an under-meaning in
  the word Aza, enabling it to be applied to the substance of dry earth,
  and indicating one of the great functions of the Oreiades, in common with
  the mosses,&mdash;the collection of earth upon rocks.</p>

  <p>4. Neither the Ericæ, as I have just said, nor Auroræ bear useful
  fruit; and the Ericæ are named from their consequent worthlessness in the
  eyes of the Greek farmer; they were the plants he 'tore up' for his bed,
  or signal-fire, his word for them including a farther sense of crushing
  or bruising into a heap. The Westmoreland shepherds now, alas! burn them
  remorselessly on the ground, (and a year since had nearly set the copse
  of Brantwood on fire just above the house.) The sense of <!-- Page 208
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>[208]</span> parched and
  fruitless existence is given to the heaths, with beautiful application of
  the context, in our English translation of Jeremiah xvii. 6; but I find
  the plant there named is, in the Septuagint, Wild Tamarisk; the mountains
  of Palestine being, I suppose, in that latitude, too low for heath,
  unless in the Lebanon.</p>

  <p>5. But I have drawn the reader's thoughts to this great race of the
  Oreiades at present, because they place for us in the clearest light a
  question which I have finally to answer before closing the first volume
  of Proserpina; namely, what is the real difference between the three
  ranks of Vegetative Humility, and Noblesse&mdash;the Herb, the Shrub, and
  the Tree?</p>

  <p>6. Between the herb, which perishes annually, and the plants which
  construct year after year an increasing stem, there is, of course, no
  difficulty of discernment; but between the plants which, like these
  Oreiades, construct for themselves richest intricacy of supporting stem,
  yet scarcely rise a fathom's height above the earth they gather and
  adorn,&mdash;between these, and the trees that lift cathedral aisles of
  colossal shade on Andes and Lebanon,&mdash;where is the limit of kind to
  be truly set?</p>

  <p>7. We have the three orders given, as no botanist could, in twelve
  lines by Milton:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flow'r'd</p>
      <p>Op'ning their various colours, and made gay</p>
      <p>Her bosom smelling sweet; and, these scarce blown,</p>
      <p>Forth flourish'd thick the clust'ring vine, forth crept</p>
<!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>[209]</span>
      <p>The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed</p>
      <p>Embattel'd in her field; and th' <i>humble shrub,</i></p>
      <p><i>And bush with frizzled hair implicit</i>: last</p>
      <p>Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread</p>
      <p>Their branches hung with copious fruits, or gemm'd</p>
      <p>Their blossoms; with high woods the hills were crown'd;</p>
      <p>With tufts the valleys and each fountain side;</p>
      <p>With borders long the rivers."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Only to learn, and be made to understand, these twelve lines
  thoroughly would teach a youth more of true botany than an entire
  Cyclopædia of modern nomenclature and description: they are, like all
  Milton's work, perfect in accuracy of epithet, while consummate in
  concentration. Exquisite in touch, as infinite in breadth, they gather
  into their unbroken clause of melodious compass the conception at once of
  the Columbian prairie, the English cornfield, the Syrian vineyard, and
  the Indian grove. But even Milton has left untold, and for the instant
  perhaps unthought of, the most solemn difference of rank between the low
  and lofty trees, not in magnitude only, nor in grace, but in
  duration.</p>

  <p>8. Yet let us pause before passing to this greater subject, to dwell
  more closely on what he has told us so clearly,&mdash;the difference in
  Grace, namely, between the trees that rise 'as in dance,' and 'the bush
  with frizzled hair.' For the bush form is essentially one taken by
  vegetation in some kind of distress; scorched by heat, discouraged by
  darkness, or bitten by frost; it is the form in which isolated knots of
  earnest plant life stay <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>[210]</span> the flux of fiery sands, bind the rents
  of tottering crags, purge the stagnant air of cave or chasm, and fringe
  with sudden hues of unhoped spring the Arctic edge of retreating
  desolation.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the trees which, as in sacred dance, make the
  borders of the rivers glad with their procession, and the mountain ridges
  statelier with their pride, are all expressions of the vegetative power
  in its accomplished felicities; gathering themselves into graceful
  companionship with the fairest arts and serenest life of man; and
  providing not only the sustenance and the instruments, but also the
  lessons and the delights, of that life, in perfectness of order, and
  unblighted fruition of season and time.</p>

  <p>9. 'Interitura'&mdash;yet these not to-day, nor to-morrow, nor with
  the decline of the summer's sun. We describe a plant as small or great;
  and think we have given account enough of its nature and being. But the
  chief question for the plant, as for the human creature, is the Number of
  its days; for to the tree, as to its master, the words are forever
  true&mdash;"As thy Day is, so shall thy Strength be."</p>

  <p>10. I am astonished hourly, more and more, at the apathy and stupidity
  which have prevented me hitherto from learning the most simple facts at
  the base of this question! Here is this myrtille bush in my
  hand&mdash;its cluster of some fifteen or twenty delicate green branches
  knitting themselves downwards into the stubborn brown <!-- Page 211
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>[211]</span> of a stem on
  which my knife makes little impression. I have not the slightest idea how
  old it is, still less how old it might one day have been if I had not
  gathered it; and, less than the least, what hinders it from becoming as
  old as it likes! What doom is there over these bright green sprays, that
  they may never win to any height or space of verdure, nor persist beyond
  their narrow scope of years?</p>

  <p>11. And the more I think the more I bewilder myself; for these bushes,
  which are pruned and clipped by the deathless Gardener into these lowly
  thickets of bloom, do not strew the ground with fallen branches and faded
  clippings in any wise,&mdash;it is the pining umbrage of the patriarchal
  trees that tinges the ground and betrays the foot beneath them: but,
  under the heather and the Alpine rose.&mdash;Well, what <i>is</i> under
  them, then? I never saw, nor thought of looking,&mdash;will look
  presently under my own bosquets and beds of lingering heather-blossom:
  beds indeed they were only a month since, a foot deep in flowers, and
  close in tufted cushions, and the mountain air that floated over them
  rich in honey like a draught of metheglin.</p>

  <p>12. Not clipped, nor pruned, I think, after all,&mdash;nor dwarfed in
  the gardener's sense; but pausing in perpetual youth and strength,
  ordained out of their lips of roseate infancy. Rose-trees&mdash;the
  botanists have falsely called the proudest of them; yet not trees in any
  wise, they, nor doomed to know the edge of axe at their <!-- Page 212
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>[212]</span> roots, nor
  the hoary waste of time, or searing thunderstroke, on sapless branches.
  Continual morning for them, and <i>in</i> them; they themselves an
  Aurora, purple and cloudless, stayed on all the happy hills. That shall
  be our name for them, in the flushed Ph&oelig;nician colour of their
  height, in calm or tempest of the heavenly sea; how much holier than the
  depth of the Tyrian! And the queen of them on our own Alps shall be
  'Aurora Alpium.'<a name="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <p>13. There is one word in the Miltonian painting of them which I must
  lean on specially; for the accurate English of it hides deep morality no
  less than botany. 'With hair <i>implicit</i>.' The interweaving of
  complex band, which knits the masses of heath or of Alpine rose into
  their dense tufts and spheres of flower, is to be noted both in these,
  and in stem structure of a higher order like that of the stone pine, for
  an expression of the instinct of the plant gathering itself into
  protective unity, whether against cold or heat, while the forms of the
  trees which have no hardship to sustain are uniformly based on the effort
  of each spray to <i>separate</i> itself from its fellows to the utmost,
  and obtain around its own leaves the utmost space of air.</p>

  <p>In vulgar modern English, the term 'implicit' used of Trust or Faith,
  has come to signify only its serenity. But the Miltonian word gives the
  <i>reason</i> of serenity: <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>[213]</span> the root and branch intricacy of closest
  knowledge and fellowship.</p>

  <p>14. I have said that Milton has told us more in these few lines than
  any botanist could. I will prove my saying by placing in comparison with
  them two passages of description by the most imaginative and generally
  well-trained scientific man since Linnæus&mdash;Humboldt&mdash;which,
  containing much that is at this moment of special use to us, are curious
  also in the confusion even of the two orders of annual and perennial
  plants, and show, therefore, the extreme need of most careful initial
  work in this distinction of the reign of Cora from that of Kronos.</p>

  <p>"The disk of the setting sun appeared like a globe of fire suspended
  over the savannah; and its last rays, as they swept the earth, illumined
  the extremities of the grass, strongly agitated by the evening breeze. In
  the low and humid places of the equinoxial zone, even when the gramineous
  plants and reeds present the aspect of a meadow, of turf, a rich
  decoration of the picture is usually wanting. I mean that variety of wild
  flowers which, scarcely rising above the grass, seem to lie upon a smooth
  bed of verdure. Between the tropics, the strength and luxury of
  vegetation give such a development to plants, that the smallest of the
  dicotyledonous family become shrubs.<a name="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> It would seem as if the <!-- Page 214
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[214]</span> liliaceous
  plants, mingled with the gramina, assumed the place of the flowers of our
  meadows. Their form is indeed striking; they dazzle by the variety and
  splendor of their colours; but, too high above the soil, they disturb
  that harmonious relation which exists among the plants that compose our
  meadows and our turf. Nature, in her beneficence, has given the landscape
  under every zone its peculiar type of beauty.</p>

  <p>"After proceeding four hours across the savannahs, we entered into a
  little wood composed of shrubs and small trees, which is called El
  Pejual; no doubt because of the great abundance of the 'Pejoa'
  (Gaultheria odorata,) a plant with very odoriferous leaves. The steepness
  of the mountain became less considerable, and we felt an indescribable
  pleasure in examining the plants of this region. Nowhere, perhaps, can be
  found collected together in so small a space of ground, productions so
  beautiful, and so remarkable in regard to the geography of plants. At the
  height of a thousand toises, the lofty savannahs of the hills terminate
  in a zone of shrubs, which by their appearance, their tortuous branches,
  their stiff leaves, and the dimensions and beauty of their purple
  flowers, remind us of what is called in the Cordilleras of the Andes the
  vegetation of the <i>paramos</i><a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> and the <i>punas</i>. We find there the
  <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>[215]</span>
  family of the Alpine rhododendrons, the thibaudias, the andromedas, the
  vacciniums, and those befarias<a name="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> with resinous leaves, which we have
  several times compared to the rhododendron of our European Alps.</p>

  <p>"Even when nature does not produce the same species in analogous
  climates, either in the plains of isothermal parallels, or on table-lands
  the temperature of which resembles that of places nearer the poles, we
  still remark a striking resemblance of appearance and physiognomy in the
  vegetation of the most distant countries. This phenomenon is one of the
  most curious in the history of organic forms. I say the history; for in
  vain would reason forbid man to form hypotheses on the origin of things:
  he is not the less tormented with these insoluble problems of the
  distribution of beings."</p>

  <p>15. Insoluble&mdash;yes, assuredly, poor little beaten phantasms of
  palpitating clay that we are&mdash;and who asked us to solve it? Even
  this Humboldt, quiet-hearted and modest watcher of the ways of Heaven, in
  the real make of him, came at last to be so far puffed up by his vain
  science in declining years that he must needs write a Kosmos of things in
  the Universe, forsooth, as if he knew all about them! when he was not
  able meanwhile, (and does not seem even to have desired the ability,) to
  put the slightest Kosmos into his own 'Personal Narrative'; but leaves
  one to gather what one wants out of <!-- Page 216 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>[216]</span> its wild growth; or
  rather, to wash or winnow what may be useful out of its débris, without
  any vestige either of reference or index; and I must look for these
  fragmentary sketches of heath and grass through chapter after chapter
  about the races of the Indian and religion of the Spaniard,&mdash;these
  also of great intrinsic value, but made useless to the general reader by
  interspersed experiment on the drifts of the wind and the depths of the
  sea.</p>

  <p>16. But one more fragment out of a note (vol. iii., p. 494) I must
  give, with reference to an order of the Rhododendrons as yet wholly
  unknown to me.</p>

  <p>"The name of vine tree, 'uvas camaronas' (Shrimp grapes?) is given in
  the Andes to plants of the genus Thibaudia on account of their <i>large
  succulent fruit</i>. Thus the ancient botanists give the name of Bear's
  vine, 'Uva Ursi,' and vine of Mount Ida, 'Vitis Idea,' to an Arbutus and
  Myrtillus which belong, like the Thibaudiæ, to the family of the
  Ericineæ."</p>

  <p>Now, though I have one entire bookcase and half of another, and a
  large cabinet besides, or about fifteen feet square of books on botany
  beside me here, and a quantity more at Oxford, I have no means whatever,
  in all the heap, of finding out what a Thibaudia is like. Loudon's
  Cyclopædia, the only general book I have, tells me only that it will grow
  well in camellia houses, that its flowers develope at Christmas, and that
  they are beautifully varied like a fritillary: whereupon I am very
  anxious to see them, and taste their fruit, and be able to <!-- Page 217
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[217]</span> tell my
  pupils something intelligible of them,&mdash;a new order, as it seems to
  me, among my Oreiades. But for the present I can make no room for them,
  and must be content, for England and the Alps, with my single class,
  Myrtilla, including all the fruit-bearing and (more or less)
  myrtle-leaved kinds; and Azalea for the fruitless flushing of the loftier
  tribes; taking the special name 'Aurora' for the red and purple ones of
  Europe, and resigning the already accepted 'Rhodora' to those of the
  Andes and Himalaya.</p>

  <p>17. Of which also, with help of earnest Indian botanists, I hope
  nevertheless to add some little history to that of our own Oreiades; but
  shall set myself on the most familiar of them first, as I partly hinted
  in taking for the frontispiece of this volume two unchecked shoots of our
  commonest heath, in their state of full lustre and decline. And now I
  must go out and see and think&mdash;and for the first time in my
  life&mdash;what becomes of all these fallen blossoms, and where my own
  mountain Cora hides herself in winter; and where her sweet body is laid
  in its death.</p>

  <p>Think of it with me, for a moment before I go. That harvest of
  amethyst bells, over all Scottish and Irish and Cumberland hill and
  moorland; what substance is there in it, yearly gathered out of the
  mountain winds,&mdash;stayed there, as if the morning and evening clouds
  had been caught out of them and woven into flowers; 'Ropes of
  sea-sand'&mdash;but that is child's magic <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span> merely, compared to
  the weaving of the Heath out of the cloud. And once woven, how much of it
  is forever worn by the Earth? What weight of that transparent tissue,
  half crystal and half comb of honey, lies strewn every year dead under
  the snow?</p>

  <p>I must go and look, and can write no more to-day; nor to-morrow
  neither. I must gather slowly what I see, and remember; and meantime
  leaving, to be dealt with afterwards, the difficult and quite separate
  question of the production of <i>wood</i>, I will close this first volume
  of Proserpina with some necessary statements respecting the operations,
  serviceable to other creatures than themselves, in which the lives of the
  noblest plants are ended: honourable in this service equally, though
  evanescent, some,&mdash;in the passing of a breeze&mdash;or the dying of
  a day;&mdash;and patient some, of storm and time, serene in fruitful
  sanctity, through all the uncounted ages which Man has polluted with his
  tears.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE SEED AND HUSK.</p>

  <p>1. Not the least sorrowful, nor least absurd of the confusions brought
  on us by unscholarly botanists, blundering into foreign languages, when
  they do not know how to use their own, is that which has followed on
  their practice of calling the seed-vessels of flowers 'egg-vessels,'<a
  name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> in Latin; thus involving
  total loss of the power of the good old English word 'husk,' and the good
  old French one, 'cosse.' For all the treasuries of plants (see Chapter
  IV., <a href="#c4p17">§ 17</a>) may be best conceived, and described,
  generally, as consisting of 'seed' and 'husk,'&mdash;for the most part
  two or more seeds, in a husk composed of two or more parts, as pease in
  their shell, pips in an orange, or kernels in a walnut; but whatever
  their number, or the method of their enclosure, let the student keep
  clear in his mind, for the base of all study of fructification, the broad
  distinction between the seed, as one thing, and the husk as another: the
  seed, essential to the continuance of the plant's race; and the husk,
  <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>[220]</span>
  adapted, primarily, to its guard and dissemination; but secondarily, to
  quite other and far more important functions.</p>

  <p>2. For on this distinction follows another practical one of great
  importance. A seed may serve, and many do mightily serve, for the food of
  man, when boiled, crushed, or otherwise industriously prepared by man
  himself, for his mere <i>sustenance</i>. But the <i>husk</i> of the seed
  is prepared in many cases for the delight of his eyes, and the pleasure
  of his palate, by Nature herself, and is then called a 'fruit.'</p>

  <p>3. The varieties of structure both in seed and husk, and yet more, the
  manner in which the one is contained, and distributed by, the other, are
  infinite; and in some cases the husk is apparently wanting, or takes some
  unrecognizable form. But in far the plurality of instances the two parts
  of the plant's treasury are easily distinguishable, and must be
  separately studied, whatever their apparent closeness of relation, or,
  (as in all natural things,) the equivocation sometimes taking place
  between the one and the other. To me, the especially curious point in
  this matter is that, while I find the most elaborate accounts given by
  botanists of the stages of growth in each of these parts of the treasury,
  they never say of what use the guardian is to the guarded part,
  irrespective of its service to man. The mechanical action of the husk in
  containing and scattering the seeds, they indeed often notice and insist
  on; but they do not tell <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page221"></a>[221]</span> us of what, if any, nutritious or
  fostering use the rind is to a chestnut, or an orange's pulp to its pips,
  or a peach's juice to its stone.</p>

  <p>4. Putting aside this deeper question for the moment, let us make sure
  we understand well, and define safely, the separate parts themselves. A
  seed consists essentially of a store, or sack, containing substance to
  nourish a germ of life, which is surrounded by such substance, and in the
  process of growth is first fed by it. The germ of life itself rises into
  two portions, and not more than two, in the seeds of two-leaved plants;
  but this symmetrical dualism must not be allowed to confuse the student's
  conception, of the <i>three</i> organically separate parts,&mdash;the
  tough skin of a bean, for instance; the softer contents of it which we
  boil to eat; and the small germ from which the root springs when it is
  sown. A bean is the best type of the whole structure. An almond out of
  its shell, a peach-kernel, and an apple-pip are also clear and perfect,
  though varied types.</p>

  <p>5. The husk, or seed-vessel, is seen in perfect simplicity of type in
  the pod of a bean, or the globe of a poppy. There are, I believe, flowers
  in which it is absent or imperfect; and when it contains only one seed,
  it may be so small and closely united with the seed it contains, that
  both will be naturally thought of as one thing only. Thus, in a
  dandelion, the little brown grains, which may be blown away, each with
  its silken parachute, are every one of them a complete husk and <!-- Page
  222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>[222]</span> seed
  together. But the majority of instances (and those of plants the most
  serviceable to man) in which the seed-vessel has entirely a separate
  structure and mechanical power, justify us in giving it the normal term
  'husk,' as the most widely applicable and intelligible.</p>

  <p>6. The change of green, hard, and tasteless vegetable substance into
  beautifully coloured, soft, and delicious substance, which produces what
  we call a fruit, is, in most cases, of the husk only; in others, of the
  part of the stalk which immediately sustains the seed; and in a very few
  instances, not properly a change, but a distinct formation, of fruity
  substance between the husk and seed. Normally, however, the husk, like
  the seed, consists always of three parts; it has an outer skin, a central
  substance of peculiar nature, and an inner skin, which holds the seed.
  The main difficulty, in describing or thinking of the completely ripened
  product of any plant, is to discern clearly which is the inner skin of
  the husk, and which the outer skin of the seed. The peach is in this
  respect the best general type,&mdash;the woolly skin being the outer one
  of the husk; the part we eat, the central substance of the husk; and the
  hard shell of the stone, the inner skin of the husk. The bitter kernel
  within is the seed.</p>

  <p>7. In this case, and in the plum and cherry, the two parts under
  present examination&mdash;husk and seed&mdash;separate naturally; the
  fruity part, which is the body of the husk, adhering firmly to the shell,
  which is its inner <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>[223]</span> coat. But in the walnut and almond, the
  two outer parts of the husk separate from the interior one, which becomes
  an apparently independent 'shell.' So that when first I approached this
  subject I divided the general structure of a treasury into <i>three</i>
  parts&mdash;husk, shell, and kernel; and this division, when we once have
  mastered the main one, will be often useful. But at first let the student
  keep steadily to his conception of the two constant parts, husk and seed,
  reserving the idea of shells and kernels for one group of plants
  only.</p>

  <p>8. It will not be always without difficulty that he maintains the
  distinction, when the tree pretends to have changed it. Thus, in the
  chestnut, the inner coat of the husk becomes brown, adheres to the seed,
  and seems part of it; and we naturally call only the thick, green,
  prickly coat, the husk. But this is only one of the deceiving tricks of
  Nature, to compel our attention more closely. The real place of
  separation, to <i>her</i> mind, is between the mahogany-coloured shell
  and the nut itself, and that more or less silky and flossy coating within
  the brown shell is the true lining of the entire 'husk.' The paler brown
  skin, following the rugosities of the nut, is the true sack or skin of
  the seed. Similarly in the walnut and almond.</p>

  <p>9. But, in the apple, two new tricks are played us. First, in the
  brown skin of the ripe pip, we might imagine we saw the part
  correspondent to the mahogany skin of the chestnut, and therefore the
  inner coat of the <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>[224]</span> husk. But it is not so. The brown skin of
  the pips belongs to them properly, and is all their own. It is the true
  skin or sack of the seed. The inner coat of the husk is the smooth,
  white, scaly part of the core that holds them.</p>

  <p>Then,&mdash;for trick number two. We should as naturally imagine the
  skin of the apple, which we peel off, to be correspondent to the skin of
  the peach; and therefore, to be the outer part of the husk. But not at
  all. The outer part of the husk in the apple is melted away into the
  fruity mass of it, and the red skin outside is the skin of its
  <i>stalk</i>, not of its seed-vessel at all!</p>

  <p>10. I say 'of its stalk,'&mdash;that is to say, of the part of the
  stalk immediately sustaining the seed, commonly called the torus, and
  expanding into the calyx. In the apple, this torus incorporates itself
  with the husk completely; then refines its own external skin, and colours
  <i>that</i> variously and beautifully, like the true skin of the husk in
  the peach, while the withered leaves of the calyx remain in the 'eye' of
  the apple.</p>

  <p>But in the 'hip' of the rose, the incorporation with the husk of the
  seed does not take place. The torus, or,&mdash;as in this flower from its
  peculiar form it is called,&mdash;the tube of the calyx, alone forms the
  frutescent part of the hip; and the complete seeds, husk and all, (the
  firm triangular husk enclosing an almond-shaped kernel,) are grouped
  closely in its interior cavity, while the calyx remains on the top in a
  large and scarcely withering star. <!-- Page 225 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>[225]</span> In the nut, the calyx
  remains green and beautiful, forming what we call the husk of a filbert;
  and again we find Nature amusing herself by trying to make us think that
  this strict envelope, almost closing over the single seed, is the same
  thing to the nut that its green shell is to a walnut!</p>

  <p>11. With still more capricious masquing, she varies and hides the
  structure of her 'berries.'</p>

  <p>The strawberry is a hip turned inside-out, the frutescent receptacle
  changed into a scarlet ball, or cone, of crystalline and delicious coral,
  in the outside of which the separate seeds, husk and all, are imbedded.
  In the raspberry and blackberry, the interior mound remains sapless; and
  the rubied translucency of dulcet substance is formed round each separate
  seed, <i>upon</i> its husk; not a part of the husk, but now an entirely
  independent and added portion of the plant's bodily form.</p>

  <p>12. What is thus done for each seed, on the <i>out</i>side of the
  receptacle, in the raspberry, is done for each seed, <i>in</i>side the
  calyx, in a pomegranate; which is a hip in which the seeds have become
  surrounded with a radiant juice, richer than claret wine; while the seed
  itself, within the generous jewel, is succulent also, and spoken of by
  Tournefort as a "baie succulente." The tube of the calyx, brown-russet
  like a large hip, externally, is yet otherwise divided, and separated
  wholly from the cinque-foiled, and cinque-celled rose, both in number of
  petal and division of treasuries; the calyx has eight points, and nine
  cells. <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>[226]</span></p>

  <p>13. Lastly, in the orange, the fount of fragrant juice is interposed
  between the seed and the husk. It is wholly independent of both; the
  Aurantine rind, with its white lining and divided compartments, is the
  true husk; the orange pips are the true seeds; and the eatable part of
  the fruit is formed between them, in clusters of delicate little flasks,
  as if a fairy's store of scented wine had been laid up by her in the
  hollow of a chestnut shell, between the nut and rind; and then the green
  changed to gold.</p>

  <p>14. I have said '<i>lastly</i>'&mdash;of the orange, for fear of the
  reader's weariness only; not as having yet represented, far less
  exhausted, the variety of frutescent form. But these are the most
  important types of it; and before I can explain the relation between
  these, and another, too often confounded with them&mdash;the
  <i>granular</i> form of the seed of grasses.&mdash;I must give some
  account of what, to man, is far more important than the form&mdash;the
  gift to him in fruit-food; and trial, in fruit-temptation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE FRUIT GIFT.</p>

  <p>1. In the course of the preceding chapter, I hope that the reader has
  obtained, or may by a little patience both obtain and secure, the idea of
  a great natural Ordinance, which, in the protection given to the part of
  plants necessary to prolong their race, provides, for happier living
  creatures, food delightful to their taste, and forms either amusing or
  beautiful to their eyes. Whether in receptacle, calyx, or true
  husk,&mdash;in the cup of the acorn, the fringe of the filbert, the down
  of the apricot, or bloom of the plum, the powers of Nature consult quite
  other ends than the mere continuance of oaks and plum trees on the earth;
  and must be regarded always with gratitude more deep than wonder, when
  they are indeed seen with human eyes and human intellect.</p>

  <p>2. But in one family of plants, the <i>contents</i> also of the seed,
  not the envelope of it merely, are prepared for the support of the higher
  animal life; and their grain, filled with the substance which, for
  universally understood name, may best keep the Latin one of
  Farina,&mdash;becoming in French, 'Farine,' and in English,
  'Flour,'&mdash;both in the perfectly nourishing elements of it, and its
  <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>[228]</span>
  easy and abundant multiplicability, becomes the primal treasure of human
  economy.</p>

  <p>3. It has been the practice of botanists of all nations to consider
  the seeds of the grasses together with those of roses and pease, as if
  all could be described on the same principles, and with the same
  nomenclature of parts. But the grain of corn is a quite distinct thing
  from the seed of pease. In <i>it</i>, the husk and the seed envelope have
  become inextricably one. All the exocarps, endocarps, epicarps,
  mesocarps, shells, husks, sacks, and skins, are woven at once together
  into the brown bran; and inside of that, a new substance is collected for
  us, which is not what we boil in pease, or poach in eggs, or munch in
  nuts, or grind in coffee;&mdash;but a thing which, mixed with water and
  then baked, has given to all the nations of the world their prime word
  for food, in thought and prayer,&mdash;Bread; their prime conception of
  the man's and woman's labor in preparing it&mdash;("whoso putteth hand to
  the <i>plough</i>"&mdash;two women shall be grinding at the
  <i>mill</i>)&mdash;their prime notion of the means of cooking by
  fire&mdash;("which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the
  <i>oven</i>"), and their prime notion of culinary office&mdash;the "chief
  <i>baker</i>," cook, or pastrycook,&mdash;(compare Bedreddin Hassan in
  the Arabian Nights): and, finally, to modern civilization, the Saxon word
  'lady,' with whatever it imports.</p>

  <p>4. It has also been the practice of botanists to confuse all the
  ripened products of plants under the general term <!-- Page 229 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>[229]</span> 'fruit.' But the
  essential and separate fruit-gift is of two substances, quite distinct
  from flour, namely, oil and wine, under the last term including for the
  moment all kinds of juice which will produce alcohol by fermentation. Of
  these, oil may be produced either in the kernels of nuts, as in almonds,
  or in the substance of berries, as in the olive, date, and coffee-berry.
  But the sweet juice which will become medicinal in wine, can only be
  developed in the husk, or in the receptacle.</p>

  <p>5. The office of the Chief Butler, as opposed to that of the Chief
  Baker, and the office of the Good Samaritan, pouring in oil and wine,
  refer both to the total fruit-gift in both kinds: but in the study of
  plants, we must primarily separate our notion of their gifts to men into
  the three elements, flour, oil, and wine; and have instantly and always
  intelligible names for them in Latin, French, and English.</p>

  <p>And I think it best not to confuse our ideas of pure vegetable
  substance with the possible process of fermentation:&mdash;so that rather
  than 'wine,' for a constant specific term, I will take
  'Nectar,'&mdash;this term more rightly including the juices of the peach,
  nectarine, and plum, as well as those of the grape, currant, and
  apple.</p>

  <p>Our three separate substances will then be easily named in all three
  languages:</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>[230]</span></p>

  <p>There is this farther advantage in keeping the third common term, that
  it leaves us the words Succus, Jus, Juice, for other liquid products of
  plants, watery, milky, sugary, or resinous,&mdash;often indeed important
  to man, but often also without either agreeable flavor or nutritious
  power; and it is therefore to be observed with care that we may use the
  word 'juice,' of a liquid produced by any part of a plant, but 'nectar,'
  only of the juices produced in its fruit.</p>

  <p>6. But the good and pleasure of fruit is not in the juice
  only;&mdash;in some kinds, and those not the least valuable, (as the
  date,) it is not in the juice at all. We still stand absolutely in want
  of a word to express the more or less firm <i>substance</i> of fruit, as
  distinguished from all other products of a plant. And with the usual
  ill-luck,&mdash;(I advisedly think of it as demoniacal
  misfortune)&mdash;of botanical science, no other name has been yet used
  for such substance than the entirely false and ugly one of
  'Flesh,'&mdash;Fr., 'Chair,' with its still more painful derivation
  'Charnu,' and in England the monstrous scientific term, 'Sarco-carp.'</p>

  <p>But, under the housewifery of Proserpina, since we are to call the
  juice of fruit, Nectar, its substance will be as naturally and easily
  called Ambrosia; and I have no doubt that this, with the other names
  defined in this chapter, will not only be found practically more
  convenient than the phrases in common use, but will more securely fix in
  the student's mind a true conception of <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span> the essential
  differences in substance, which, ultimately, depend wholly on their
  pleasantness to human perception, and offices for human good; and not at
  all on any otherwise explicable structure or faculty. It is of no use to
  determine, by microscope or retort, that cinnamon is made of cells with
  so many walls, or grape-juice of molecules with so many sides;&mdash;we
  are just as far as ever from understanding why these particular
  interstices should be aromatic, and these special parallelopipeds
  exhilarating, as we were in the savagely unscientific days when we could
  only see with our eyes, and smell with our noses. But to call each of
  these separate substances by a name rightly belonging to it through all
  the past variations of the language of educated man, will probably enable
  us often to discern powers in the thing itself, of affecting the human
  body and mind, which are indeed qualities infinitely more its <i>own</i>,
  than any which can possibly be extracted by the point of a knife, or
  brayed out with a mortar and pestle.</p>

  <p>7. Thus, to take merely instance in the three main elements of which
  we have just determined the names,&mdash;flour, oil, and
  ambrosia;&mdash;the differences in the kinds of pleasure which the tongue
  received from the powderiness of oat-cake, or a well-boiled
  potato&mdash;(in the days when oat-cake and potatoes were!)&mdash;from
  the glossily-softened crispness of a well-made salad, and from the cool
  and fragrant amber of an apricot, are indeed distinctions between the
  essential virtues of things which <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>[232]</span> were made to be
  <i>tasted</i>, much more than to be eaten; and in their various methods
  of ministry to, and temptation of, human appetites, have their part in
  the history, not of elements merely, but of souls; and of the
  soul-virtues, which from the beginning of the world have bade the barrel
  of meal not waste, nor the cruse of oil fail; and have planted, by waters
  of comfort, the fruits which are for the healing of nations.</p>

  <p>8. And, again, therefore, I must repeat, with insistance, the claim I
  have made for the limitation of language to the use made of it by
  educated men. The word 'carp' could never have multiplied itself into the
  absurdities of endo-carps and epi-carps, but in the mouths of men who
  scarcely ever read it in its original letters, and therefore never
  recognized it as meaning precisely the same thing as 'fructus,' which
  word, being a little more familiar with, they would have scarcely abused
  to the same extent; they would not have called a walnut shell an
  intra-fruct&mdash;or a grape skin an extra-fruct; but again, because,
  though they are accustomed to the English 'fructify,'
  'frugivorous'&mdash;and 'usufruct,' they are unaccustomed to the Latin
  'fruor,' and unconscious therefore that the derivative 'fructus' must
  always, in right use, mean an <i>enjoyed</i> thing, they generalize every
  mature vegetable product under the term; and we find Dr. Gray coolly
  telling us that there is no fruit so "likely to be mistaken for a seed,"
  as a grain of corn! a grain, whether of corn, or any other <!-- Page 233
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>[233]</span> grass, being
  precisely the vegetable structure to which frutescent change is forever
  forbidden! and to which the word <i>seed</i> is primarily and perfectly
  applicable!&mdash;the thing to be <i>sown</i>, not grafted.</p>

  <p>9. But to mark this total incapability of frutescent change, and
  connect the form of the seed more definitely with its dusty treasure, it
  is better to reserve, when we are speaking with precision, the term
  'grain' for the seeds of the grasses: the difficulty is greater in French
  than in English: because they have no monosyllabic word for the
  constantly granular 'seed'; but for us the terms are all simple, and
  already in right use, only not quite clearly enough understood; and there
  remains only one real difficulty now in our system of nomenclature, that
  having taken the word 'husk' for the seed-vessel, we are left without a
  general word for the true fringe of a filbert, or the chaff of a grass. I
  don't know whether the French 'frange' could be used by them in this
  sense, if we took it in English botany. But for the present, we can
  manage well enough without it, one general term, 'chaff,' serving for all
  the grasses, 'cup' for acorns, and 'fringe' for nuts.</p>

  <p>10. But I call this a <i>real</i> difficulty, because I suppose, among
  the myriads of plants of which I know nothing, there may be forms of the
  envelope of fruits or seeds which may, for comfort of speech, require
  some common generic name. One <i>un</i>real difficulty, or shadow of
  difficulty, remains in our having no entirely comprehensive <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>[234]</span> name for seed
  and seed-vessel together than that the botanists now use, 'fruit.' But
  practically, even now, people feel that they can't gather figs of
  thistles, and never speak of the fructification of a thistle, or of the
  fruit of a dandelion. And, re-assembling now, in one view, the words we
  have determined on, they will be found enough for all practical service,
  and in such service always accurate, and, usually, suggestive. I repeat
  them in brief order, with such farther explanation as they need.</p>

  <p>11. All ripe products of the life of flowers consist essentially of
  the Seed and Husk,&mdash;these being, in certain cases, sustained,
  surrounded, or provided with means of motion, by other parts of the
  plant; or by developments of their own form which require in each case
  distinct names. Thus the white cushion of the dandelion to which its
  brown seeds are attached, and the personal parachutes which belong to
  each, must be separately described for that species of plants; it is the
  little brown thing they sustain and carry away on the wind, which must be
  examined as the essential product of the floret;&mdash;the 'seed and
  husk.'</p>

  <p>12. Every seed has a husk, holding either that seed alone, or other
  seeds with it.</p>

  <p>Every perfect seed consists of an embryo, and the substance which
  first nourishes that embryo; the whole enclosed in a sack or other
  sufficient envelope. Three essential parts altogether. <!-- Page 235
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>[235]</span></p>

  <p>Every perfect husk, vulgarly pericarp, or 'round-fruit,'&mdash;(as
  periwig, 'round-wig,')&mdash;consists of a shell, (vulgarly endocarp,)
  rind, (vulgarly mesocarp,) and skin, (vulgarly epicarp); three essential
  parts altogether. But one or more of these parts may be effaced, or
  confused with another; and in the seeds of grasses they all concentrate
  themselves into bran.</p>

  <p>13. When a husk consists of two or more parts, each of which has a
  separate shaft and volute, uniting in the pillar and volute of the
  flower, each separate piece of the husk is called a 'carpel.' The name
  was first given by De Candolle, and must be retained. But it continually
  happens that a simple husk divides into two parts corresponding to the
  two leaves of the embryo, as in the peach, or symmetrically holding
  alternate seeds, as in the pea. The beautiful drawing of the pea-shell
  with its seeds, in Rousseau's botany, is the only one I have seen which
  rightly shows and expresses this arrangement.</p>

  <p>14. A Fruit is either the husk, receptacle, petal, or other part of a
  flower <i>external to the seed</i>, in which chemical changes have taken
  place, fitting it for the most part to become pleasant and healthful food
  for man, or other living animals; but in some cases making it bitter or
  poisonous to them, and the enjoyment of it depraved or deadly. But, as
  far as we know, it is without any definite office to the seed it
  contains; and the change takes <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page236"></a>[236]</span> place entirely to fit the plant to the
  service of animals.<a name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In its perfection, the Fruit Gift is limited to a temperate zone, of
  which the polar limit is marked by the strawberry, and the equatorial by
  the orange. The more arctic regions produce even the smallest kinds of
  fruit with difficulty; and the more equatorial, in coarse, oleaginous, or
  over-luscious masses.</p>

  <p>15. All the most perfect fruits are developed <i>from exquisite forms
  either of foliage or flower</i>. The vine leaf, in its generally
  decorative power, is the most important, both in life and in art, of all
  that shade the habitations of men. The olive leaf is, without any rival,
  the most beautiful of the leaves of timber trees; and its blossom, though
  minute, of extreme beauty. The apple is essentially the fruit of the
  rose, and the peach of her only rival in her own colour. The cherry and
  orange blossom are the two types of floral snow.</p>

  <p>16. And, lastly, let my readers be assured, the economy of blossom and
  fruit, with the distribution of water, <!-- Page 237 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[237]</span> will be found
  hereafter the most accurate test of wise national government.</p>

  <p>For example of the action of a national government, rightly so called,
  in these matters, I refer the student to the Mariegolas of Venice,
  translated in Fors Clavigera; and I close this chapter, and this first
  volume of Proserpina, not without pride, in the words I wrote on this
  same matter eighteen years ago. "So far as the labourer's immediate
  profit is concerned, it matters not an iron filing whether I employ him
  in growing a peach, or in forging a bombshell. But the difference to him
  is final, whether, when his child is ill, I walk into his cottage, and
  give it the peach,&mdash;or drop the shell down his chimney, and blow his
  roof off."</p>

<h3>INDEX I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">DESCRIPTIVE NOMENCLATURE.</p>

  <p>Plants in perfect form are said, at <span class="correction"
  title="'page 29' in original">page <a href="#page26">26</a></span>, to
  consist of four principal parts: root, stem, leaf, and flower. (Compare
  Chapter V., <a href="#c5p2">§ 2</a>.) The reader may have been surprised
  at the omission of the fruit from this list. But a plant which has borne
  fruit is no longer of 'perfect' form. Its flower is dead. And, observe,
  it is further said, at <span class="correction" title="'page 73' in original"
  >page <a href="#page65">65</a></span>, (and compare Chapter III., <a
  href="#c3p2">§ 2</a>,) that the use of the fruit is to produce the
  flower: not of the flower to produce the fruit. Therefore, the plant in
  perfect blossom, is itself perfect. Nevertheless, the formation of the
  fruit, practically, is included in the flower, and so spoken of in the
  fifteenth line of the same page.</p>

  <p>Each of these four main parts of a plant consist normally of a certain
  series of minor parts, to which it is well to attach easily remembered
  names. In this section of my index I will not admit the confusion of idea
  involved by alphabetical arrangement of these names, but will sacrifice
  facility of reference to clearness of explanation, and taking the four
  great parts of the plant in <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>[239]</span> succession, I will give the list of the
  minor and constituent parts, with their names as determined in
  Proserpina, and reference to the pages where the reasons for such
  determination are given, endeavouring to supply, at the same time, any
  deficiencies which I find in the body of the text.</p>

  nourishment is received <a href="#page32">32</a></p>

  <p>The inessential or accidental parts of roots, which are attached to
  the roots of some plants, but not to those of others, (and are, indeed,
  for the most part absent,) are three: namely, Store-Houses, Refuges, and

  <p>I. <span class="sc">The Stem (Stemma)</span> proper.&mdash;A growing
  or advancing shoot which sustains all the other organs of the plant <a
  href="#page136">136</a></p>

  <p>It may grow by adding thickness to its sides without advancing; but
  its essential characteristic is the vital power of Advance <a
  href="#page136">136</a> <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>[241]</span></p>

  <p>It may be round, square, or polygonal, but is always roundly minded <a
  href="#page136">136</a></p>

  <p>Its structural power is Spiral <a href="#page137">137</a></p>

  <p>It is essentially branched; having subordinate leaf-stalks and
  flower-stalks, if not larger branches <a href="#page139">139</a></p>

  <p>It developes the buds, leaves, and flowers of the plant.</p>

  <p>This power is not yet properly defined, or explained; and referred to
  only incidentally throughout the eighth chapter <a
  href="#page134">134</a>-<a href="#page138">138</a></p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">The Leaf-Stalk (Cymba)</span> sustains, and
  expands itself into, the Leaf <a href="#page133">133</a>, <a
  href="#page134">134</a></p>

  <p>It is essentially furrowed above, and convex below <a
  href="#page134">134</a></p>

  <p>It is to be called in Latin, the Cymba; in English, the Leaf-Stalk <a
  href="#page135">135</a></p>

  <p>III. <span class="sc">The Flower-Stalk (Petiolus)</span>:</p>

  <p>It is essentially round <a href="#page130">130</a></p>

  <p>It is usually separated distinctly at its termination from the flower
  <a href="#page130">130</a>, <a href="#page131">131</a></p>

  <p>It is to be called in Latin, Petiolus; in English, Flower-stalk <a
  href="#page130">130</a></p>

  <p>These three are the essential parts of a stem. But <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>[242]</span> besides
  these, it has, when largely developed, a permanent form: namely,</p>

  <p>IV. <span class="sc">The Trunk.</span>&mdash;A non-advancing mass of

  <p>III. <span class="sc">The Calyx</span> (The Hiding-place).&mdash;The

  <p>V. <span class="sc">The Treasury</span>.&mdash;The part of the flower

<p class="cenhead">V. <span class="sc">The Seed</span>.</p>

  <p>I must once more desire the reader to take notice that, under the four
  sections already defined, the morphology of the plant is to be considered
  as complete, and that we are now only to examine and name, farther, its
  <i>product</i>; and that not so much as the germ of its own future
  descendant flower, but as a separate substance which it is appointed to
  form, partly to its own detriment, for the sake of higher creatures. This
  product consists essentially of two parts: the Seed and its Husk.</p>

  <p>I. <span class="sc">The Seed</span>.&mdash;Defined <a
  href="#page220">220</a></p>

  <p>It consists, in its perfect form, of three parts <a
  href="#page222">222</a></p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>These three parts are not yet determinately named in the text: but I
  give now the names which will be usually attached to them.</p>

  <p>A. <i>The Sacque</i>.&mdash;The outside skin of a seed <a
  href="#page221">221</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>[248]</span></p>

  <p>B. <i>The Nutrine</i>.&mdash;A word which I coin, for general
  applicability, whether to the farina of corn, the substance of a nut, or
  the parts that become the first leaves in a bean <a
  href="#page221">221</a></p>

  <p>C. <i>The Germ</i>.&mdash;The origin of the root <a
  href="#page221">221</a></p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">The Husk</span>.&mdash;Defined <a
  href="#page222">222</a></p>

  <p>Consists, like the seed when in perfect form, of three parts.</p>

  <p>A. <i>The Skin</i>.&mdash;The outer envelope of all the seed
  structures <a href="#page222">222</a></p>

  <p>B. <i>The Rind</i>.&mdash;The central body of the Husk. <a
  href="#page222">222</a>-<a href="#page235">235</a></p>

  <p>C. <i>The Shell</i>.&mdash;Not always shelly, yet best described by
  this general term; and becoming a shell, so called, in nuts, peaches,
  dates, and other such kernel-fruits <a href="#page222">222</a></p>

  <p>The products of the Seed and Husk of Plants, for the use of animals,
  are practically to be massed under the three heads of <span
  class="sc">Bread</span>, <span class="sc">Oil</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Fruit</span>. But the substance of which bread is made is more
  accurately described as Farina; and the pleasantness of fruit to the
  taste depends on two elements in its substance: the juice, and the pulp
  containing it, which may properly be called Nectar and Ambrosia. We have
  therefore in all four essential products of the Seed and Husk&mdash;</p>

  <p>Besides these all-important products of the seed, others are formed in
  the stems and leaves of plants, of which no account hitherto has been
  given in Proserpina. I delay any extended description of these until we
  have examined the structure of wood itself more closely; this intricate
  and difficult task having been remitted (p. 195) to the days of coming
  spring; and I am well pleased that my younger readers should at first be
  vexed with no more names to be learned than those of the vegetable
  productions with which they are most pleasantly acquainted: but for older
  ones, I think it well, before closing the present volume, to indicate,
  with warning, some of the obscurities, and probable fallacies, with which
  this vanity of science encumbers the chemistry, no less than the
  morphology, of plants.</p>

  <p>Looking back to one of the first books in which our new knowledge of
  organic chemistry began to be displayed, thirty years ago, I find that
  even at that period the organic elements which the cuisine of the
  laboratory had already detected in simple Indigo, were the
  following:&mdash; <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>[250]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Isatine, Bromisatine, Bidromisatine;</p>
      <p>Chlorisatine, Bichlorisatine;</p>
      <p>Chlorisatyde, Bichlorisatyde;</p>
      <p>Chlorindine, Chlorindoptene, Chlorindatmit;</p>
      <p>Chloranile, Chloranilam, and, Chloranilammon.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And yet, with all this practical skill in decoction, and accumulative
  industry in observation and nomenclature, so far are our scientific men
  from arriving, by any decoctive process of their own knowledge, at
  general results useful to ordinary human creatures, that when I wish now
  to separate, for young scholars, in first massive arrangement of
  vegetable productions, the Substances of Plants from their Essences; that
  is to say, the weighable and measurable body of the plant from its
  practically immeasurable, if not imponderable, spirit, I find in my three
  volumes of close-printed chemistry, no information what ever respecting
  the quality of volatility in matter, except this one sentence:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The disposition of various substances to yield vapour is very
  different: and the difference depends doubtless on the relative power of
  cohesion with which they are endowed."<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Even in this not extremely pregnant, though extremely <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>[251]</span> cautious,
  sentence, two conditions of matter are confused, no notice being taken of
  the difference in manner of dissolution between a vitally fragrant and a
  mortally putrid substance.</p>

  <p>It is still more curious that when I look for more definite
  instruction on such points to the higher ranks of botanists, I find in
  the index to Dr. Lindley's 'Introduction to Botany'&mdash;seven hundred
  pages of close print&mdash;not one of the four words 'Volatile,'
  'Essence,' 'Scent,' or 'Perfume.' I examine the index to Gray's
  'Structural and Systematic Botany,' with precisely the same success. I
  next consult Professors Balfour and Grindon, and am met by the same
  dignified silence. Finally, I think over the possible chances in French,
  and try in Figuier's indices to the 'Histoire des Plantes' for
  'Odeur'&mdash;no such word! 'Parfum'&mdash;no such word.
  'Essence'&mdash;no such word. 'Encens'&mdash;no such word. I try at last
  'Pois de Senteur,' at a venture, and am referred to a page which
  describes their going to sleep.</p>

  <p>Left thus to my own resources, I must be content for the present to
  bring the subject at least under safe laws of nomenclature. It is
  possible that modern chemistry may be entirely right in alleging the
  absolute identity of substances such as albumen, or fibrine, whether they
  occur in the animal or vegetable economies. But I do not choose to assume
  this identity in my nomenclature. It may, perhaps, be very fine and very
  instructive to <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>[252]</span> inform the pupils preparing for
  competitive examination that the main element of Milk is Milkine, and of
  Cheese, Cheesine. But for the practical purposes of life, all that I
  think it necessary for the pupil to know is that in order to get either
  milk or cheese, he must address himself to a Cow, and not to a Pump; and
  that what a chemist can produce for him out of dandelions or cocoanuts,
  however milky or cheesy it may look, may more safely be called by some
  name of its own.</p>

  <p>This distinctness of language becomes every day more desirable, in the
  face of the refinements of chemical art which now enable the ingenious
  confectioner to meet the demands of an unscientific person for (suppose)
  a lemon drop, with a mixture of nitric acid, sulphur, and stewed bones.
  It is better, whatever the chemical identity of the products may be, that
  each should receive a distinctive epithet, and be asked for and supplied,
  in vulgar English, and vulgar probity, either as essence of lemons, or
  skeletons.</p>

  <p>I intend, therefore,&mdash;and believe that the practice will be found
  both wise and convenient,&mdash;to separate in all my works on natural
  history the terms used for vegetable products from those used for animal
  or mineral ones, whatever may be their chemical identity, or resemblance
  in aspect. I do not mean to talk of fat in seeds, nor of flour in eggs,
  nor of milk in rocks. Pace my prelatical friends, I mean to use the word
  'Alb' for vegetable albumen; and although I cannot without pedantry avoid
  <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>[253]</span>
  using sometimes the word 'milky' of the white juices of plants, I must
  beg the reader to remain unaffected in his conviction that there is a
  vital difference between liquids that coagulate into butter, or congeal
  into India-rubber. Oil, when used simply, will always mean a vegetable
  product: and when I have occasion to speak of petroleum, tallow, or
  blubber, I shall generally call these substances by their right
  names.</p>

  <p>There are also a certain number of vegetable materials more or less
  prepared, secreted, or digested for us by animals, such as wax, honey,
  silk, and cochineal. The properties of these require more complex
  definitions, but they have all very intelligible and well-established
  names. 'Tea' must be a general term for an extract of any plant in
  boiling water: though when standing alone the word will take its accepted
  Chinese meaning: and essence, the general term for the condensed dew of a
  vegetable vapour, which is with grace and fitness called the 'being' of a
  plant, because its properties are almost always characteristic of the
  species; and it is not, like leaf tissue or wood fibre, approximately the
  same material in different shapes; but a separate element in each family
  of flowers, of a mysterious, delightful, or dangerous influence,
  logically inexplicable, chemically inconstructible, and wholly, in
  dignity of nature, above all modes and faculties of form.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> At least, it throws off its
  flowers on each side in a bewilderingly pretty way; a real lily can't
  branch, I believe: but, if not, what is the use of the botanical books
  saying "on an unbranched stem"?</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> I have by happy chance just added
  to my Oxford library the poet Gray's copy of Linnæus, with its
  exquisitely written Latin notes, exemplary alike to scholar and
  naturalist.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> It was in the year 1860, in
  June.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> Admirably engraved by Mr.
  Burgess, from my pen drawing, now at Oxford. By comparing it with the
  plate of the same flower in Sowerby's work, the student will at once see
  the difference between attentive drawing, which gives the cadence and
  relation of masses in a group, and the mere copying of each flower in an
  unconsidered huddle.</p>

  is a folio series, exquisitely begun, a hundred years ago; and not yet
  finished.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> <span class="sc">Lucca</span>,
  <i>Aug. 9th, 1874.</i>&mdash;I have left this passage as originally
  written, but I believe the dome is of accumulated earth. Bringing home,
  here, evening after evening, heaps of all kinds of mosses from the hills
  among which the Archbishop Ruggieri was hunting the wolf and her whelps
  in Ugolino's dream, I am more and more struck, every day, with their
  special function as earth-gatherers, and with the enormous importance to
  their own brightness, and to our service, of that dark and degraded state
  of the inferior leaves. And it fastens itself in my mind mainly as their
  distinctive character, that as the leaves of a tree become wood, so the
  leaves of a moss become earth, while yet a normal part of the plant. Here
  is a cake in my hand weighing half a pound, bright green on the surface,
  with minute crisp leaves; but an inch thick beneath in what looks at
  first like clay, but is indeed knitted fibre of exhausted moss. Also, I
  don't at all find the generalization I made from the botanical books
  likely to have occurred to me from the real things. No moss leaves that I
  can find here give me the idea of resemblance to pineapple leaves; nor do
  I see any, through my weak lens, clearly serrated; but I do find a
  general tendency to run into a silky filamentous structure, and in some,
  especially on a small one gathered from the fissures in the marble of the
  cathedral, white threads of considerable length at the extremities of the
  leaves, of which threads I remember no drawing or notice in the botanical
  books. Figure 1 represents, magnified, a cluster of these leaves, with
  the germinating stalk springing from their centre; but my scrawl was
  tired and careless, and for once, Mr. Burgess has copied <i>too</i>
  accurately.</p>

  century, tells us that, wishing to preserve a field of good land from the
  roots of an avenue of elms which were exhausting it, he cut a ditch
  between the field and avenue to intercept the roots. But he saw with
  surprise those of the roots which had not been cut, go down behind the
  slope of the ditch to keep out of the light, go under the ditch, and into
  the field again." And the Swiss naturalist Bonnet said wittily, apropos
  of a wonder of this sort, "that sometimes it was difficult to distinguish
  a cat from a rosebush."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> The only use of a great part
  of our existing nomenclature is to enable one botanist to describe to
  another a plant which the other has not seen. When the science becomes
  approximately perfect, all known plants will be properly figured, so that
  nobody need describe them; and unknown plants be so rare that nobody will
  care to learn a new and difficult language, in order to be able to give
  an account of what in all probability he will never see.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> <i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;We now
  ascend the roots of the mountain called Kastaniá, and begin to pass
  between it and the mountain of Alonístena, which is on our right. The
  latter is much higher than Kastaniá, and, like the other peaked summits
  of the Mænalian range, is covered with firs, and deeply at present with
  snow. The snow lies also in our pass. At a fountain in the road, the
  small village of Bazeníko is half a mile on the right, standing at the
  foot of the Mænalian range, and now covered with snow.</p>

  <p>Saetá is the most lofty of the range of mountains, which are in face
  of Levídhi, to the northward and eastward; they are all a part of the
  chain which extends from Mount Khelmós, and connects that great summit
  with Artemisium, Parthenium, and Parnon. Mount Saetá is covered with
  firs. The mountain between the plain of Levídhi and Alonístena, or, to
  speak by the ancient nomenclature, that part of the Mænalian range which
  separates the Orchomenia from the valleys of Helisson and Methydrium, is
  clothed also with large forests of the same trees; the road across this
  ridge from Lavídhi to Alonístena is now impracticable on account of the
  snow.</p>

  <p>I am detained all day at Levídhi by a heavy fall of snow, which before
  the evening has covered the ground to half a foot in depth, although the
  village is not much elevated above the plain, nor in a more lofty
  situation than Tripolitzá.</p>

  <p><i>March 4th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday afternoon and during the night the
  snow fell in such quantities as to cover all the plains and adjacent
  mountains; and the country exhibited this morning as fine a snow-scene as
  Norway could supply. As the day advanced and the sun appeared, the snow
  melted rapidly, but the sky was soon overcast again, and the snow began
  to fall.</p>

  Liddell.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> I find this chapter rather
  tiresome on re-reading it myself, and cancel some farther criticism of
  the imitation of this passage by Virgil, one of the few pieces of the
  Æneid which are purely and vulgarly imitative, rendered also false as
  well as weak by the introducing sentence, "Volvitur Euryalus leto," after
  which the simile of the drooping flower is absurd. Of criticism, the
  chief use of which is to warn all sensible men from such business, the
  following abstract of Diderot's notes on the passage, given in the
  'Saturday Review' for April 29th, 1871, is worth preserving. (Was the
  French critic really not aware that Homer <i>had</i> written the lines
  his own way?)</p>

  <p>"Diderot illustrates his theory of poetical hieroglyphs by no
  quotations, but we can show the manner of his minute and sometimes
  fanciful criticism by repeating his analysis of the passage of Virgil
  wherein the death of Euryalus is described:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16">'Pulchrosque per artus</p>
      <p>It cruor, inque humeros cervix collapsa recumbit;</p>
      <p>Purpureus veluti cum flos succisus aratro</p>
      <p>Languescit moriens; lassove papavera collo</p>
      <p>Demisere caput, pluvia cum forte gravantur.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"The sound of 'It cruor,' according to Diderot, suggests the image of
  a jet of blood; 'cervix collapsa recumbit,' the fall of a dying man's
  head upon his shoulder; 'succisus' imitates the use of a cutting scythe
  (not plough); 'demisere' is as soft as the eye of a flower; 'gravantur,'
  on the other hand, has all the weight of a calyx, filled with rain;
  'collapsa' marks an effort and a fall, and similar double duty is
  performed by 'papavera,' the first two syllables symbolizing the poppy
  upright, the last two the poppy bent. While thus pursuing his minute
  investigations, Diderot can scarcely help laughing at himself, and
  candidly owns that he is open to the suspicion of discovering in the poem
  beauties which have no existence. He therefore qualifies his eulogy by
  pointing out two faults in the passage. 'Gravantur,' notwithstanding the
  praise it has received, is a little too heavy for the light head of a
  poppy, even when filled with water. As for 'aratro,' coming as it does
  after the hiss of 'succisus,' it is altogether abominable. Had Homer
  written the lines, he would have ended with some hieroglyph, which would
  have continued the hiss or described the fall of a flower. To the hiss of
  'succisus' Diderot is warmly attached. Not by mistake, but in order to
  justify the sound, he ventures to translate 'aratrum' into 'scythe,'
  boldly and rightly declaring in a marginal note that this is not the
  meaning of the word."</p>

  changed the form of the novel, that his habitual interjection should be

  remaining then in Scotland, taking the place of the mediæval 'by St.
  Andrew,' we in England, long before the Scot, having lost all sense of
  the Puritanical appeal to private conscience, as of the Catholic oath,
  'by St. George;' and our uncanonized 'by George' in sonorous rudeness,
  ratifying, not now our common conscience, but our individual opinion.</p>

  I could not show the variety of the curves of the involucre without
  enlarging; and if, on this much increased scale, I had tried to draw the
  flower, it would have taken Mr. Allen and me a good month's more work.

  the spreading flower is indicated, but the involucre drawn with

  <p><a name="Nt_56" href="#NtA_56">[56]</a> The four races of this order
  are more naturally distinct than botanists have recognized. In Clarissa,
  the petal is cloven into a fringe at the outer edge; in Lychnis, the
  petal is terminated in two rounded lobes and the fringe withdrawn to the
  top of the limb; in Scintilla, the petal is divided into two <i>sharp</i>
  lobes, without any fringe of the limb; and in Mica, the minute and
  scarcely visible flowers have simple and far separate petals. The
  confusion of these four great natural races under the vulgar or
  accidental botanical names of spittle-plant, shore-plant, sand plant,
  etc., has become entirely intolerable by any rational student; but the
  names 'Scintilla,' substituted for Stellaria, and 'Mica' for the utterly
  ridiculous and probably untrue Sagina, connect themselves naturally with
  Lychnis, in expression of the luminous power of the white and sparkling
  blossoms.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_57" href="#NtA_57">[57]</a> Clytia will include all the

  the limits of Margarita and Alcestis.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_58" href="#NtA_58">[58]</a> The reader must observe that
  the positions given in this more developed system to any flower do not
  interfere with arrangements either formerly or hereafter given for
  memoria technica. The name of the pea, for instance (alata), is to be
  learned first among the twelve cinqfoils, p. 214, above; then transferred
  to its botanical place.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
